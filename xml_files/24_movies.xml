		<description>With two protruding front teeth, a slightly sly air and a certain penchant for carrots, Bugs Bunny is one of the most popular cartoon heroes, especially in the United States. In this anthology, in addition to the bunny, there are other heroes of Warner cartoons: Sylvester and Tweety, engaged in a merciless but useless hunt, Daffy Duck (the duck who over time imitates Walt Disney's Donald Duck more and more) and others yet.</description>
		<notes>These are many small independent stories, which can be viewed individually. The anthology also includes "One Froggy Evening", one of the masterpieces of designer Chuck Jones.</notes>

		<description>Samantha, not yet eighteen, leaves the comforts of family and runs away from home. By chance she meets Paolo, a young drifter, and falls in love with him, but Paolo is part of a gang of Camorra riders fighting a rival gang. Paolo is part of the group sent to kill the leader of the rivals and Samantha decides to leave him because she is afraid of the turning point her life is taking.</description>
		<notes>Luigi Perelli, the director of the "Piovra", occasionally makes a few forays into cinema but is more at ease on television. The young Camorra has the face of Kim Rossi Stuart.</notes>

In fact, he is the son of very poor peasants, she the rich heiress of a powerful family. The fate, however, was not kind to the little girl who was nailed to a wheelchair by a serious illness. Contact is established between the two thanks to a pony foal that both of them are fascinated by.</description>

		<description>Five boys from Baltimore have a habit of meeting up periodically for dinner and making jokes together. One of them, Boogie, is in trouble because of his passion for betting: he owes two thousand dollars to a gangster and continues to bet and lose to find them. Others have marital or sex-related problems, and each gets some joke.</description>
		<notes>A cast of will be famous for Levinson's directorial debut. Bitter and very well written: jokes are seen as a manifestation of immaturity rather than lightheartedness; Rourke enhances his charge of dark handsome. Guttenberg is the good guy of the bunch.</notes>

		<description>With a stratagem, the penniless and somewhat philosopher Marquis Parascandolo wants to prove that work and money are useless. To do this, he spreads the rumor, which is actually false, that one of his "disciples", the carpenter Vincenzino Esposito, has received a large inheritance. Of course it happens that the man is suddenly respected by everyone and really enriches himself.</description>
		<notes>Taken from the play by Armando Curcio that the De Filippo had brought to the stage two years earlier. More than cinema, it is filmed theater, but the two brothers are always grown up.</notes>

		<description>Investigations into two murders committed in a small Sicilian village lead to the conclusion that it was an honor killing. Paolo Laurana, a high school teacher, is not convinced and confides these doubts of his to the lawyer Rosello. Continuing her investigations, however, Laurana realizes that the instigator of the double murder is precisely the lawyer, with the complicity of Luisa, widow of one of the victims. Laurana dies under the blows of a killer; the lawyer Rosello and Luisa get married.</description>
		<notes>Champion of the cinema of civil commitment, Elio Petri refines his style, starting from this film, corrosive and lucid in the denunciation of the mafia culture.</notes>

		<description>In the throes of a double murder, Jerry Beck, of the Los Angeles police, falls into the hell of a neo-Nazi movement that in the land of freedom wants to exclude blacks, Jews and homosexuals in the name of an alleged superiority of the white race. The FBI also enters the field, but Beck will have to do everything himself, even using rather brutal ways to be able to eliminate the culprits.</description>
		<notes>When it comes to talking about mysterious plots, John Frankenheimer ("Seven Days in May", "Go and Kill") is great. A good thriller, despite the presence of Don Johnson who is not exactly a monster of flexibility.</notes>

The boy thinks he has a great chance to become someone, but when his father is arrested, who does not want any witnesses against him, he becomes his most ruthless enemy.</description>
		<notes>Powerful and brutal thriller, second work by James Foley, which makes the comparison between father and son with the tones of a classic tragedy. Excellent interpreters: the young Sean Penn manages to figure well next to a teacher like Walken, Oscar 1979 for "The Hunter".</notes>

		<description>Martin and Laura Burney have been married for more than three years, but for her it was three years of terror. Her husband alternates (rare) moments of tenderness with inexplicable fits of jealousy, after which Laura is forced to treat her bruises. One evening husband and wife are on a boat and Laura, who has always said she cannot swim, lets herself slip overboard and runs away. Now that Laura is free, she takes the name of Sara, goes to live in Iowa and rebuilds another life. But Martin discovers her and enters her house.</description>

He is a teacher from the local college, but he leads a double life: at night, stripping off his respectable professional clothes, he turns into a ruthless killer. He then throws his victims into a basement where a strange zombie people live. But even the "professor" will have a bad end.</description>

		<description>After yet another marital quarrel, Gino disappears in a sewage collector and his wife is accused of murder. At the trial, the woman recalls the passionate relationship with her husband, made up of slaps and reconciliations. This is for a middle-class lady on the jury to open her eyes to her own marital miseries. The trial risks ending in a heavy sentence, but the alleged murderer is thankfully alive and well.</description>
		<notes>The film represents an attempt to resurrect the Italian comedy in its most biting value by relying on a supercast, but the operation fails: commonplaces are wasted and Marcello Fondato is neither Risi nor Monicelli.</notes>

A sheriff and his aide try to shed some light on the matter before it's too late.</description>

Although Cummings is blind, the plan is perfect and everything works, but not completely.</description>

		<notes>In the overused vein of college films, this gem stands out which, while not going beyond the traditional canons of comedy, manages to entertain in an intelligent way. Thanks above all to the overflowing personality of actor Rodney Dangerfield.</notes>

From then on we witness Harry and June's attempts to dispose of the corpse. For one reason or another the attempts never go through, but the ending hides a surprise.</description>
		<notes>Troubled film, edited and reassembled by production. The idea is nice even if not very original ("S.O.B.", "Weekend with the dead", etc ...). Judge Reinhold is the one from "Beverly Hills Cop" and is a handsome comic talent.</notes>

		<description>After her husband's death, Francesca decides to go and meet her mother-in-law. The journey is very difficult, also because Francesca is about to give birth to a child and the house is isolated in the woods. Upon his arrival he discovers that his mother-in-law is dead and that in his house lives a hag who hides a murderous son and a subnormal daughter. It is the latter who will help Francesca in a decisive way when the other two inhabitants of the house try to kill her and the child who has been born in the meantime.</description>
		<notes>Specialist Lamont Johnson has built an effective "Rosemary's Baby" story, as obsessive as the atmosphere of the house where all the action takes place.</notes>

His heart is so tender that one day he even ends up taking an abandoned boy home with him.

Now that he has raised a good amount of money, however, he does not know how to invest it best and, on the contrary, begins to squander the money to demonstrate his new social status. The sudden well-being makes her easy prey for characters who just want to cheat her money: she will return, poor again, to her little shop.</description>

A friend of theirs explains what is happening: a hospital ship that sank in the last war with its cargo of 70,000 vials of morphine landed on a Spanish galleon containing gold and sank two centuries earlier. The news leaks out and the adventurer Cloche tries to get hold of everything: morphine can in fact be transformed into heroin. But the two young people are opposed.</description>

Colin, an apprentice photographer and Suzette, a fashion designer, love each other, but she ends up marrying Henley, the great Mayfair tailor, much to the boy's desperation. Colin continues his life, amidst the turmoil that already heralds the "fabulous" 60s and racial clashes, during which, as a good democrat, he sided with minorities. And after the storm he will also find his Suzette.</description>
		<notes>An admittedly nostalgic operation (the reference point is Minnelli), "Absolute Beginners" has to its credit, in order of merit, Patsy Kensit, David Bowie, an enthralling leitmotif, but it remains a lifeless film.</notes>

		<notes>After seeing the first dailies Federico Fellini said to Pasolini: go back to writing, it's better. Instead, the director-poet's debut film is a masterpiece. Sacred music, proletarian faces, life stories, and the shadow of the sacred. Pasolini invented a new way of making cinema, combining the acquisitions of the nouvelle vague with the aesthetics of the silent and the Bunuel of "Los Olvidados". The film had problems with censorship. In a small part there is Elsa Morante who is an inmate.</notes>

		<description>Benjamin, a black writer, is injured while demonstrating against apartheid in Cape Town. Taking refuge in a villa, he is discovered by the white Cinthia, who convinces a friend to hide him in a safer place, in her house by the sea. Cinthia, conditioned by the apartheid laws, represses her nascent feelings towards the writer. But when he finds out that her friend has slept with him, she reports him to the police.</description>
		<notes>If the streets of hell are paved with good intentions, this film also wins a place with good reason, drowning its ambitions to denounce apartheid in a very banal cartoon.</notes>

		<description>The war is about to end and in Genoa a group of partisans is charged with a dangerous mission: to prevent the Nazis from taking the machinery of an arms factory with them to Germany. The action is difficult, but they obtain the solidarity of the workers who thus also defend their jobs. When all seems lost, the decisive intervention of a battalion of Alpine troops leads the group to victory.</description>
		<notes>Directorial debut for Carlo Lizzani who takes his cue from a real news story to talk about the relationship between workers and the Resistance. The film was completely self-produced by the director and the interpreters associated with a cooperative. Vintage Neorealism, with a credible Gina Lollobrigida and the protagonist of "Bicycle Thieves".</notes>

		<description>On the island of Cascara an old oil well is reopened, which instead of black gold releases mineral water. American businessmen, British paratroopers, film crews, mercenaries and assorted revolutionaries begin to circulate around the event. It all ends with an unexpected rock concert which also includes Ringo Starr and Eric Clapton.</description>
		<notes>Michael Caine becomes involved in the operation as governor of the island, while Brenda Vaccaro tries in vain to look like Carmen Miranda. Executive producer of this demented-surreal farce is former Beatle George Harrison who also produced "Lunch Royal" with Maggie Smith and "Life of Brian" by Monty Python. Although inferior to them, even this madness has rhythm and bite.</notes>

Sergeant Jackson knows that behind the murders is the industrialist Dellaplane, whose son he had arrested a few years earlier, for a degradation as a reward. The industrialist's second wife is killed by Dellaplane himself, after she is convinced of his guilt. For Jackson the investigation becomes a personal matter and he gets to the head without being too scrupulous. He will only take to heart Sidney, Dellaplane's lover.</description>

The boy in fact proves to be absolutely "allergic" to any form of authority. After careful consideration, Lane decides that the best cure is to get him a wife. He then summons Annie Boley, a young widow with a child. Not happy Lane establishes a strict clause: only after the marriage Lee will be able to take possession of the paternal ranch. The only problem is that, little by little, the two end up falling in love seriously.</description>

		<description>Three young people, two boys and a girl, walking around the streets of Florence: one works in a private radio, one is unemployed and a third is a painter. Small and big dramas, small stories with a comic minimalism intertwine and melt.</description>
		<notes>After the classic rigmarole of cabaret and television, even the three Tuscan comedians of the "Giancattivi" group have landed on the big screen. Theirs is a vaguely surreal comedy, where the regionalistic comic vis is combined with the Giovanilese so in vogue at the time and with a subdued social analysis. The result is not bad: the three will then take different paths, with the results that everyone knows.</notes>

Bo is as good as he is naive and does not even realize that he is the straw man of a group of businessmen. He notices it only when he is wounded in a bombing, but at that point Sylvester tries to play the same game with Ada, Bo's wife. The woman, however, despite her past is not exactly crystal clear, does not allow herself to be exploited.</description>

During the Second World War, two British soldiers are parachuted on that island to organize resistance against the Japanese. Learoyd gets the promise of immunity for her desertion and the recognition of her "kingdom".</description>
		<notes>Battles, massacres, and a bitter ending. The utopia of a return to nature, the virile friendship between the former sergeant and the English captain (Havers), the balance of a reality that can only be different from the premises (and promises), are the themes of the film. . Which breathes above all in the spaces and times of a melancholy adventure, narrated by a Milius ("The wind and the lion", but also the sounding of "Apocalypse now") who wallows in his themes.</notes>

		<notes>It is the great love, against the backdrop of the First World War. This was the first film adaptation of Ernest Hamingway's novel, never distributed in Italy because it was unwelcome to fascism, which did not tolerate its explicit anti-war message. Frank Borzage was a director specializing in love stories with a hint of tragedy (but the ending of the film was very sweetened compared to the book) who built a film of great appeal, thanks also to the fame of the actors.</notes>

Mario loses his head and Dorina loses love. Despite the various distractions Mario arrives at graduation and, on the day of his return to the country, he sees Dorina again who gives him an embroidered wallet.</description>
		<notes>It is the famous comedy by Camasio and Oxilia, brought to the cinema so many times that it seems like a nursery rhyme. This version, however, boasts the not very heavy style of Ferdinando Maria Poggioli, the screenplay by Salvatori Gotta and (uncredited because he is a Jew) Giacomo Debenedetti, and the presence of Clara Calamai, naturally in the role of the lost and kept woman.</notes>

		<description>In the aftermath of the Merlin law and the consequent closure of the "closed houses", four girls of life decide to open a restaurant with the help of a certain Ercole, an unscrupulous businessman. He intends to make the place a cover for a new dating house, but they take a taste for the new job and prefer not to return to life as usual. But this attempt to lead an honest existence will only yield them a denunciation.</description>
		<notes>One of the many successful portraits of women by Pietrangeli, thanks to the screenwriters Scola and Maccari and the music of Piero Piccioni.</notes>

		<description>The quiet and happy family ménage of Karin and Andrea, a couple living in a small town in the Swedish province, is shocked by the arrival of David, a young Jewish archaeologist. A stormy relationship begins between Karin and David, destined to last until Andrea, who learns of it, forces his wife to make a final decision. He will have to choose between him and the lover.</description>
		<notes>A bizarre film by the master, considered by all unsolved and even kitsch for some visual refinements. However, the portrait of the couple leaves its mark, and the performers are very good. Andersson and Von Sydow are genuine Bergmanians, but Gould doesn't look bad either.</notes>

		<description>Having discovered her husband Franco in the arms of her best friend, Marta promises him a similar revenge. She then has no other intention than to scare him, but Franco fears that the threat is real and therefore takes all the tricks of which Marta is capable. Eventually Franco understands the lesson and gets forgiveness from his wife.</description>
		<notes>Catherine Spaak is in great shape and Nino Manfredi is dumb at the right point. Add to them the cynicism of Caprioli and the graces of Buccella. The direction (as well as the screenplay) is by Pasquale Festa Campanile, better with the pen than with the camera.</notes>

		<description>Ted is a taxi driver abandoned by his girlfriend, a stewardess on airliners. To win her back, he embarks on the flight on which she is on duty, but surprises are not lacking. The lunch served on board is in fact spoiled, and among the intoxicated there are the pilots. Urged by the girl Ted, despite never having flown a plane, he still manages to land saving everyone.</description>
		<notes>The directors became famous by inventing a new surreal comedy (they also owe the series "A Blunt Bullet"). Here they make fun of the many tearful "Airport" (there is also the little girl who has to go to the hospital for a transplant) and the results are hilarious.</notes>

		<description>It is August 21, 1941. In the Paris subway a young Communist kills an officer of the German navy. Pucheu, minister of the interior of the Vichy government, "compensates" the Germans by setting up a special court that tries six communist militants and puts three to death, thanks to the enactment of a retroactive anti-terrorist law and a tame trial.</description>
		<notes>Also in this film, as often happened to him, the director Costa Gavras, Athenian by origin but French by adoption, denounces the terrible crimes of human dignity perpetrated by power in a conventional way, with flatly didactic and rhetorical results.</notes>

		<description>On 5 August 1952, on the Dominici estate in Provence, the bodies of three passing Englishmen were found: husband, wife and little daughter. No traces of violence or theft. The Dominici are notoriously leftist militants and a mysterious meeting was held in their home that very night. The two sons are immediately accused of the murder, but it is then the father who accuses himself. The trial proceedings dismantle the "evidence" by demonstrating its vanity; the man is sentenced to death on the basis of some clues, but then pardoned ...</description>

When the suspect is killed, the suspects are directed towards Peck, an ambiguous and violent character. The conflict between him and Avila takes on increasingly bitter tones, until the final confrontation.</description>
		<notes>Mike Figgis made his debut in 1988 with a discreet noir, here he remains faithful to the most sordid metropolitan environments. Effective Richard Gere who pours his undoubted appeal into the character of the villain. Andy Garcia is an apt antagonist.</notes>

The result is an intricate case from which the nice Bernice will, of course, be the winner.</description>

Here the story is seen from the side of the British.</notes>

When he has almost collected the necessary money he finds himself involved by the beautiful Magdalene (Andress) in the hunt for an American who has been wanted for thirty years because he spies on the Nazis. After many ups and downs the enterprise succeeds and John will never return to America.</description>

The catchy soundtrack of Guido and Maurizio De Angelis, which remained in the hit parade for a long time, contributed to the fortune of the film.</notes>

Then she foolishly risks her life in a dive, is rescued and begins to look at the captain with different eyes.</description>

		<description>The prologue resembles a documentary on scorpions then, in a stretch of inaccessible coast, some bandits try in vain to prevent the landing of civil and religious authorities who found "Imperial Rome". The action moves to the outskirts of Paris where a reception takes place in a luxurious villa. Among the guests is a young diplomat (Gaston Modot) who, amidst the general scandal, tries in every way to mate with the boss' daughter (Lya Lys). In the epilogue, the Duke of Blangis, a character from Sade's "One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom", has the appearance of Jesus. Born within the surrealist group, the film was challenged by right-wing movements that attacked the cinema and smeared the screen. The prefectural decree that prohibited its screening was never revoked and only expired after fifty years.</description>

Jimmy, on the other hand, is a thief who still has to serve three days in prison, but escapes a few hours to go to a baseball game. Naturally it is Jimmy who finds Spencer's agenda and from this arises a long string of misunderstandings.</description>
		<notes>Filofax herself sponsored the film, and it shows. The idea is not bad, but it seems to have already seen it a little too many times (for example "Unachair for two"). The "strange couple" Belushi-Grodin works very well.</notes>

Seeing himself discovered, Bond forced to flee with a spectacular action manages to return to London.</description>
		<notes>The moment of the ski escape from the villa is probably the most interesting point of the whole film. For the rest, the film does not differ much from the others in the series, except perhaps for the final bitterness. In addition 007 had just lost the face of Sean Connery, the real and only interpreter of the agent, and had not yet found that of the nice Roger Moore.</notes>

		<description>James Bond is in Istanbul to steal the Lector from the Russians, a universal decipherer also coveted by the criminal organization Specter. This puts Tatiana, secretary of the Russian embassy, ??after him, but the girl falls in love with him. From here on, adventures and twists follow each other relentlessly, until ...</description>
		<notes>In all likelihood, the masterpiece of the saga dedicated to 007: a perfect plot, with suspense, irony and almost "camp" taste, correct references to the novel by Ian Fleming and a Connery in top form. Among the frequent moments with a high rate of eroticism, at least the sequence of the fight between two gypsies under the smug gaze of Bond should be remembered.</notes>

		<description>A nice gift arrives British Intelligence front company. A golden bullet engraved with a number: 007. Clear message, sent (perhaps) by a killer of Cuban origin, Scaramanga, raised in a circus and a lover of animals, beautiful women and his proverbial golden gun. No one has ever seen him: but James Bond tries to track him down by following various tracks, from Beirut to Hong Kong to an island in Thailand, the secret base of the assassin. Alongside 007 the bungler Mary Goodnight.</description>
		<notes>Based on the latest novel by Ian Fleming, in which the figure of the killer acquires the appearance of the alter ego of the famous spy. In the film version, the parallel is completely lost, despite Christopher Lee giving life to a thick Scaramanga. Fun is guaranteed as always, but it is a minor Bond, whose production suffered the consequences of the divorce between the two historic producers of the series, Saltzman and Broccoli (the latter will continue alone).</notes>

		<description>The criminal organization Specter captures US and USSR spacecraft in orbit. The two countries accuse each other of the bad joke. The purpose of the action is to provoke a Third World War. James Bond must penetrate the extinct volcano of the Japanese island where the base of operations of the bandits is hidden.</description>
		<notes>Sean Connery's fifth date with 007. The film is a pleasant and spectacular cocktail of action, beautiful women and ingenious secret weapons. Bond's antagonist is this time the evil Blofeld, an excellent Donald Pleasence. The author of the effective and playful screenplay is Roald Dahl, a highly refined author of children's novels.</notes>

James Bond is tasked with locating the Specter base and disrupting the criminal plot. Bond succeeds in his aim, naturally with the help of a beautiful girl, Domino, who, needless to say, falls in love with him. The mission ends with a spectacular submarine battle.</description>

		<notes>While not among the milestones of the series, the second of the four Bonds directed by Hamilton does not disappoint the expectations of fans: the deployment of technology is up to the situation, and not even the suspense is lacking. But Connery shows a slight decline in conviction, so much so that in the following _Live and let die_ the baton will pass to Roger Moore.</notes>

		<description>A drug trafficking is discovered in a high school in South Carolina. The game, however, is so hard that a policeman immediately leaves the skin. Then agent Hauser is called on the scene, a policeman from another city who, thanks to the fact that he is not known in the area, manages to infiltrate the criminal organization.</description>
		<notes>Thanks also to the help of a beautiful narcotics agent, Hauser completes the mission, a first feature, not too successful. The most unique thing is that the new director is actor John Stockwell, better known as "Cougar" in Tony Scott's "Top Gun".</notes>

		<description>The story faithfully follows that of Verdi's opera: Aida is an Ethiopian slave with whom the Egyptian hero Radames, betrothed to Princess Amneris, is in love. Radames, after defeating the Ethiopian army led by Aida's father, obtains clemency for the vanquished from the Pharaoh. Princess Amneris discovers the general's love for Aida and, in revenge, accuses them of treason. While Aida manages to escape, Radames is sentenced to death.</description>
		<notes>Made at a time when films based on operas were a thriving genre, this Aida is a bit naive and uses well-known voices from the opera house, attributing them to photogenic faces, such as that of Sophia Loren called to play the protagonist and mimic the song in flashback.</notes>

Flying low to escape the radar, however, it hits an obstacle and falls into the sea. The commander, having regained command, leads the difficult rescue operations.</description>
		<notes>The film is yet another variation on the catastrophic plane genre inaugurated by "Airport" and continued with "Airport '75". Little suspense, banality between characters and apotheosis of special effects.</notes>

		<description>In order to be left permanently in peace by the gang to which she belonged in the past, Maria must lend herself to killing a man at the airport. He accepts for the sake of his little girl, but things go differently than expected: another killer kills the intended victim just as Maria thinks she is giving up. Frightened, the woman tries to escape and leaves the little girl to a nice taxi driver, Ernie, who has fallen in love with her. Ernie himself finds a way to save Maria and arrest the criminals.</description>

		<description>The young Akiko falls in the middle of a family in which she was expecting the return of her father, who had left for Japan 18 years earlier. The girl is, in reality, the illegitimate daughter that the man, on the verge of death, sent to Italy for someone to take care of her. Who gets along with it immediately, who thinks of exploiting his ingenuity for little noble purposes, who impresses the heart of the girl from the East.</description>
		<notes>The exotic figure of Akiko is the only variant of a film which, for the rest, remains in the vein of the typical Italian comedy, without particular strengths or specific weaknesses.</notes>

		<description>A young actress, who specializes in underwear advertising, has been receiving strange phone calls from a stranger for some time. One evening, as she prepares to leave for the weekend, a maniac attacks her and rapes her. But the girl reacts and the situation is reversed: now it is the maniac who is the woman's merchandise, who wonders if it is better to kill him or hand him over to the police. The relationship between the victim and his executioner has been investigated many times by the cinema. This honest thriller tries to mix "The Night Porter" with "Bonds!", But between Cavani and Almodóvar, the monotony of the already seen wins.</description>

		<description>Having become the undisputed master of Chicago in the 1920s, Al Capone always manages to get away with it. Justice does not manage to unmask his responsibility in the thousand illicit affairs with which he enriches himself immeasurably. Only the discovery of a tax infringement allows it to be arrested and prosecuted.</description>
		<notes>Richard Wilson is a genre director (westerns and detective stories above all), but of considerable skill, particularly in the direction of the actors. Here the character of Al Capone is entrusted to an already famous and particularly effective Rod Steiger. The black and white of the film also effectively evokes the atmosphere of the time.</notes>

		<description>Husband, wife and a child. Life flows quietly in a menage without flickers, but without dramas. Until the man dies in a car accident. The affection between mother and son is strengthened and a "posthumous" little brother fills the created void. Taken from a good novel by James Agee, one of the greatest American film critics of all time, as well as a screenwriter ("Death runs on the river"). The realization is correct, but inferior to the big model.</description>

		<description>Tony Petrocelli is a young American lawyer whose professional life seems confined to small provincial lawsuits. One day he accepts the defense of Dr. Jack Harrison accused of killing his wife. All the evidence is against his assistant and the jury sentences him to life in prison. However, Petrocelli manages to get the trial reopened by presenting a version of the facts as valid as that of the prosecution.</description>
		<notes>The opera is one of the classic trial films where the skill lies in building a screenplay that will stand up to the times of the trial. The television series Petrocelli was based on this film by Sidney J. Furie</notes>

After the murder, François barricades himself at home, surrounded by the police forces, and spends the whole night thinking about the events that led to this dramatic circumstance. In this way, his entire past life flows slowly.</description>
		<notes>A masterpiece of French poetic realism with a stunning black and white photography and with Jean Gabin in great shape. Jacques Prevert's screenplay, with its famous use of the flash-back, is a monument of pessimism and melancholy, so much so that the film (released on the eve of World War II) was withdrawn as "demoralizing".</notes>

		<description>In 1862 John, engaged to his schoolmate Nell, searches with her for the mythical tree of life. But when he meets Susanna on his way, it will be she who will marry, abandoning Nell. John then fights in the Secession war against slavery, even if Susanna, contrary to his ideas, abandons him.</description>
		<notes>Against the background of this ambitious historical-psychological fresco there is "Gone with the Wind" and the role of Susanna offers Taylor the opportunity to compete with a complex character, prototype, in some respects, of others that she will later resume. Millard Kaufman's screenplay does not do justice to the Ross Lockridge novel from which it is based.</notes>

		<description>The car of the driven doctor (unmarried) is found, overturned and with irrefutable traces of a female presence, near the Adam's Tree, a place dedicated to amorous meetings. So word spreads quickly of an adventure between the doctor and the duchess just arrived from America (complete with an aristocratic husband). Not so, at least for the moment. Then, what comes from what ...</description>
		<notes>From the comedy "The success" by Alfredo Testoni, a film which, with the dialogues of Corrado Alvaro, thanks to a brilliant direction and the vivacity of the performers, is even more entertaining than the play, although highly acclaimed at the time. Enjoyable even today.</notes>

		<description>Corrado Valeri, naval officer, has a slightly frivolous wife of whom he is hopelessly jealous. This situation affects his military life with continuous shortcomings. To avoid complications he should resign, but the General Staff offers him an alternative: accept a difficult mission. Valeri thinks to let it go, but the heroism shown by his teammates in a dangerous situation makes him reflect.</description>
		<notes>We are in the years of consensus and cinema was supposed to serve to celebrate the glories of the regime and its ideology. As the nation was being rearmed, it was logical that many films extolled the so-called military virtues.</notes>

At the same time Alfie is hospitalized and here too he kills hearts. One of his conquests, Lily, becomes pregnant in turn and Alfie causes her to have an abortion. But the weight of the years, a certain dissatisfaction and a growing sense of loneliness definitively change the eternal boy Alfie.</description>

Forced on a sexual "tour de force" to give her a child, when Mariarosa becomes pregnant Alfredo is relegated to sleep in the cellar, but at least he's a little freer. He meets Carolina and he finally falls in love.</description>

Here he comes across the singular case of Nina Jonescu, a Romanian refugee accused of murder. Invited her to his villa, Phillip is the victim of a series of strange incidents: does it happen that Nina is trying to kill him?</description>
		<notes>The relationship between the writer and his characters has always fascinated the world of cinema, which has been able to skillfully exploit all the comic or disturbing implications of this relationship. Bruce Beresford, on the other hand, is happy to create a yellowish story with the amazing model Paulina Porizkova.</notes>

Another herb brings eternal love but Alice decides not to use it: she prefers to live alone in a modest apartment.</description>

Along the way, mother and son stop in Albuquerque, where the woman is hired as a singer in a motel. Here Alice has a love affair with a married man, which ends up in a barrel. Resuming the journey, the two stop again: to raise money Alice gets hired by a restaurant. Here too a man appears, but Tom strongly opposes this relationship.</description>
		<notes>A young but already biting Scorsese offers us this chronicle of frustrated people of the American dream, devoted to a mediocre life. An Oscar to the good Ellen Burstyn. The film gave birth (obviously more sweetened) the TV series "Alice".</notes>

Arriving with a team of space marines at the colony, she discovers that the pioneers have been victims of the proliferation of monstrous aliens, very similar to the one that attacked the Nostromo. But the even worse fact is that, on that planet, the terrible generator of those creatures has nested with its immense nest. Eliminated one by one all of Ripley's companions, in a titanic clash the warrior woman and the alien giantess fight for the safety of her progeny, the other for the life of the only human survivor of the colony, Newt, a child .</description>
		<notes>Exception that proves the rule: a better sequel to the model. James Cameron ("Titanic") shapes the tension superbly and transforms the story into a kind of metaphor for motherhood. Ripley against the alien-mother, against each other a (r) mate. A masterpiece of science fiction cinema, a jewel of superfine suspense.</notes>

Dave, a university in the province, is a very original young man for an American: his sporting idol is in fact the Italian cycling champion Felice Gimondi; in his spare time Dave listens to opera and sweats on the pedals to emulate the great model. In fact, he dreams of competing with Italian cyclists and he succeeds: reality disappoints him, but does not normalize him.</description>
		<notes>The story is set in an unusual America, where the values ??of diversity, love and friendship prevail, and is directed with admirable measure by the Englishman Peter Yates ("The servant", 1984). In the young group of the cast, an almost rookie Dennis Quaid.</notes>

		<description>Joan Wilder (Turner), shy writer of sentimental novels, is warned that her sister was kidnapped in Colombia where she went to look for her missing husband who, before dying, sent her a map that allows her to find a precious green stone. . The girl decides to leave for Colombia where she will try to exchange the map with her sister's freedom. Arriving in Cartagena, however, she is chased not only by the two confused kidnappers, but also by a dangerous drug dealer who has sensed the existence of the map. Joan would be lost if Jack Colton (Douglas), a likeable adventurer in all similar to the heroes created by Wilder in her novels, did not intervene at her side and lived with her a thousand adventures, fortunately with a happy ending. Joan will return to New York completely different: beautiful, self-confident, self-confident and very much in love.</description>

		<description>Former bandit Matt befriends Davey, and becomes sheriff. But the past returns, and Davey betrays him. Despite himself, Matt must then go after him.</description>
		<notes>Ray didn't like this film of his, which is compelling and remarkably original. The western structure and that of the conflict between fathers and sons cover an evident anti-maccartist prabola on the execution of the innocent and intolerance.</notes>

		<description>Heading to Los Angeles to join Monica (Kaprisky), a beautiful and unscrupulous architecture student, Jesse (Gere), a car thief by profession, kills an agent. Monica, at first unaware, then conquered by the thrill of the situation, is involved in a reckless escape. But the extreme partnership, made up of sex and complicity, does not cross the Mexican border.</description>
		<notes>Although incomparable with "A bout de souffle", the masterpiece Godard drew from an idea by Truffaut in 1959, McBride's remake is nevertheless effective. Gere and Kaprisky well update the erotic charge that moves the whole story.</notes>

		<description>Charlot is wealthy this time and can afford to spend the evenings in the company of friends and raising his elbow. But the homecoming becomes a nightmare. Meanwhile, the apartment is not his but that of a friend who lent him the keys. And, above all, the furniture and other objects of that unknown house seem to conspire against him, causing him endless trouble.</description>
		<notes>A medium-length comedian (also known by the Italian period title, Charlot Comes Late), among the many who have imposed the genius of Chaplin. The actor is alone on stage throughout the film, and the wayward objects anticipate many Buster Keaton gags.</notes>

		<notes>California paradise becomes a nightmare in an unfairly underrated film, based on the novel _Cutter and Bone_ by Newton Thornburg and scripted by Jeffrey Alan Friskin. The three protagonists are really good, and the direction of the Czechoslovakian exile Ivan Passer _ (Dr. Creator specialist in miracles) _ does not miss a beat. Will the original scenes of sex and violence have passed through the meshes of TV censorship?</notes>

		<description>Victor, a respected doctor of an American citizen, is murdered. At the crime scene the police find some hair of his nephew Felix, little more than a boy. The young man is tried and sentenced to 25 years in prison.</description>
		<notes>The name of Karel Reisz is linked to important films such as "Crazy Morgan", "The Warriors of Hell", "The French Lieutenant's Woman". In recent years it seems to be unable to find the touch that raised it above the pile. This thriller, although written by Arthur Miller who adapted his own text, is confusing and not very exciting.</notes>

Little foot, who has lost contact with the rest of the group, joins four other puppies and with them reaches the Great Valley.</description>

The beautiful Jessie, daughter of the kidnapped, hires Allan Quatermain, adventurer and man of action, to look for her father.</description>
		<notes>Inoffensive remake of a novel by Rider Haggard already transposed in '37 by Robert Stevenson and in '50 by Compton Bennet. The film piles up alleged comic gags and flat action scenes in an attempt to clone the Indiana Jones adventure saga. However, the operation is unsuccessful. Sharon Stone was not yet famous.</notes>

Using his skills with accents and disguises, he seduces numerous women in order to retrieve the information needed to rob the Los Angeles airport bank. So he marries beautiful Inger just to have a secure base for operations ...</description>
		<notes>Thriller centered around a robbery that slips too often into comedy, thanks to James Coburn's Don Juan's exploits. Ugly the Italian title that takes away from the film a certain taste for the grotesque, having no meaning. It remains a very difficult plot to follow which makes the film more complicated than enjoyable.</notes>

In particular, he seeks the quiet atmosphere that allows him to write the long-pondered novel, but their rural idyll is shattered in the face of an assorted and predictable series of inconveniences.</description>
		<notes>Difficult to draw more than modest work from such an exploited and inconsistent story, even for the solid George Roy Hill. The protagonist couple gasps. Alongside Chase appears Madolyn Smith, a young travoltine in 1980 in "Urban Cowboy".</notes>

		<description>Laurel and Hardy travel the world with a strange orchestra operated by just the two of them. They meet a young man who, after having fooled them with certain petrol-generating capsules of his invention, involves them in his stupid enterprise. The trio meets a beautiful girl threatened by the underworld ... We are in 1943 and the magic moment of the two comedians is behind them. Yet this Allegri cheaters for one last time brings them back to the glories of the past. For the quality of the gags, rhythm and liveliness of the story, the film is undoubtedly the best among those played after parting with their traditional producer, Hal Roach.</description>

Under the orders of a very strict marshal, we find the usual soldier who always and only complains about food, the one who thinks only of women and who is super recommended, the one who is naïve because he comes from the countryside. There is the captain close to retirement and, therefore, detached, indulgent and understanding. There is no shortage of recalled who arrive at the barracks suddenly, leading to desperation the non-commissioned officer in charge of dressing them and finding them accommodation.</description>

		<description>A blonde heiress from Philadelphia is about to marry a rich but foolish dude; However, her ex-husband manages to win her back thanks to the help of a journalist friend, who teaches the girl what true love is and what things are worth living for.</description>
		<notes>Remake of the amazing comedy _Scandalo a Filadelfia_ by George Cukor (1940), the film is enlivened by a very happy soundtrack, signed by Cole Porter and entrusted to the two actor-singers and the sly humor of Louis Armstrong; who, for his part, performs some absolutely delightful jazz pieces with the eponymous _High Society_ in the head.</notes>

		<description>Holly is charming, but she has a very strange demeanor. She is almost always shy and introverted, but every now and then she transforms and seems prey to an irrepressible anger. Her gestures and words seem almost heterodirect, as if inside her there was another personality that sometimes prevails. A real mystery: to be solved, however, very quickly because Holly's mother was murdered and the girl accused of the murder.</description>
		<notes>Drew Barrymore, the last scion of a family of actors, as a child she played "E.T.", as a teenager she had to detoxify from alcoholism. Here he is the protagonist of a predictable thriller with no strokes of genius.</notes>

		<notes>Enzo Trapani's cinematic borderline who would become more famous as a variety television director. The film is actually the pretext for the limelight of the most famous singers of the time. It is fully part of the "musicarielli" line but does not have the unscrupulous naivety of the most famous titles. Original music by Ennio Morricone and Luis Enriquez.</notes>

Even if the woman disappears immediately, Saverio was struck by her and goes in search of her, discovering a world of violence alien to him and, perhaps, changing his life.</description>
		<notes>The Paduan director Carlo Mazzacurati in his third film (after "Italian Night" and "Il prete bello") alternates dramatic tones with ironic moments, and shows the other side of a reality unknown to those who lock themselves up in their armor of insensitivity . Silvio Orlando in the role of the dentist is very good.</notes>

When his partner Anna Gretz is also kidnapped, Sébastien is forced to investigate a confusing intrigue of spies and traitors.</description>

Ruth will reach the top of success, but her climb will be marked by dramatic moments and, also, by a conflict of feelings between Marty and a pianist who has fallen in love with the singer.</description>
		<notes>The screenplay, that is the "construction" of the characters and the articulation of the story are worth more than the contribution of the direction of Charles Vidor, an average craftsman. Excellent James Cagney in a role in which he mixes devotion and toughness, good Doris Day, singer and dramatic actress.</notes>

The son of a bigot and a drunkard, the young priest has a very particular religious sense that makes him recite very sensual prayers and subject him to senseless privations. When, due to an excess of fasting, he risks dying, he is lovingly assisted by Albine, a girl without a family, with whom he ends up falling in love.</description>

		<description>Tom Jefford (James Stewart), a former colonizer, has a good relationship with the Indians, but for this reason he is frowned upon by many whites. After the sudden massacre of a detachment of soldiers Tom, who seeks justification for his Indian friends, risks being lynched. He is rescued by a general and then agrees to go with him to the tribe of Cochise (Jeff Chandler), where he marries an Indian girl (Debra Paget).</description>
		<notes>Authentic forerunner of the critical "revision" in regard to the Indians, the film made, at the time, a sensation. But its merits are not only of content. The story is clever and compelling, the interpreters are effective, and the overall performance is very good.</notes>

His relationship begins to go into crisis when the man finds himself still fond of his ex-wife and son. He writes a letter to Hélène to say goodbye, but soon after has a fatal accident. The wife will not say anything to the woman so as not to grieve her.</description>
		<notes>Elegant typically French drama, based on the skill of the actors and on a plot capable of developing the romantic aspects of the story. For this film (which came out at the same time as "Love Story" and "Anonimo veneziano") there was talk of cinematic neo-romanticism as opposed to the post-sixty-eight commitment.</notes>

		<description>Tired of her relationship with a baroness, a second lieutenant of the dragons Franz interrupts her when he falls in love with the charming young Christine. He did not take into account, however, the jealousy of the baron who, having discovered his wife's betrayal, challenges him to a duel and kills him. The woman shocked by the death of her beloved dies, in turn, falling from the balcony of her residence.</description>
		<notes>Second adaptation from Schnitzler's "Liebelei" after the splendid one by Ophüls (who had also shot a modest French version played by Magda Schneider, Romy's mother), it is far from its incisiveness and limits itself to emphasizing the more romance of the story.</notes>

		<description>Julien is a high school student and has not yet turned sixteen. He happens to meet Ellen, a high-class call girl, and fall madly in love with her. She returns the feeling passionately because she sees the lost purity in him. But then she realizes that for the boy's sake the relationship must be severed: she leaves him - so she says to Julien's father - because she loves him too much.</description>
		<notes>Between comedy and drama, the film is about an impossible love and the relationship between parents and children, but without digging into the arguments much. More than the interpretation of Mimsy Farmer in the role of the courtesan, it is worth mentioning the young Pascal Sellier.</notes>

		<description>The young publisher Lewis Venable believes that the love letters written by a great poet, who has been dead for years, to his mistress are kept in the Venetian palace in which he lives. The publisher enters the palace and discovers that the woman's young niece suffers from hallucinations and believes herself to be the lover of the dead poet.</description>
		<notes>Based on Henry James' "The Aspern Correspondence", the film makes use of the excellent interpretation of Susan Hayward and above all of Cummings. The staging is very good, adhering not to the letter of the text but to the fantastic universe of the writer, who skillfully mixes reality and fantasy, passion, love and horror.</notes>

		<description>After a year and a half living together, Mike and Susan decide to get married, even though all the couples around them seem to be on the verge of splitting up. Starting with the respective parents, in fact, even the longest-lasting unions are on the verge of breaking up with consequent aftermath of betrayal, quarrels, misunderstandings and spite. The wedding ceremony of Mike and Susan also serves all their poorly accompanied acquaintances to understand something more and better about the deep meaning of a union desired by the great love that binds the protagonists ever more strongly.</description>

		<description>In 1884, in Wisconsin, two lumberjacks, Barney Glasgow and Swan Bostrom, fall in love with the same girl, Lotta. But Barney, who is also preferred by the young woman, chooses to marry her employer's daughter. Many years later, when Lotta is now dead, Barney falls in love with her daughter, and this time he finds himself rivaling his own son Richard. Then he realizes it's a bit late.</description>
		<notes>Filmed almost entirely by Hawks, by Ross Lederman for the forest scenes and finished by Wyler (due to Hawks 'disagreement with the producer), the film is based on a novel by Edna Ferber, unwittingly inspired by the life of Hawks' father.</notes>

		<description>James Penfield is a young and ambitious journalist who wants to write a book on the English intervention in Suez in 1956. For the launch of the work he seeks alliances with a mature historiographer, who is, however, more interested in his physical than intellectual qualities. Penfield still gets to publish and is successful, largely thanks to his skill in the art of compromise. For him, social climbing is just the beginning.</description>

In London, however, meanwhile, the plague breaks out.</description>

David Carradine and young Barbara Hershey show their talent; and then there is John Carradine, a noble father.</notes>

		<description>American colleges should be places of study, culture and sport, but in the cinematic genre that tells them with ease, the most popular sports are courtship and nocturnal encounters with girls, as well as a whole other series of goliardic adventures.</description>
		<notes>This is the classic adolescent-collegiate film that, from "Animal House" down, is always in vogue. Across the usual range of gimmicks, we find old and new screen glories: from Sylvia Kristel to Phoebe Cates to Matthew Modine. The spirit that pervades the film is that of "Porky's" and similar amenities.</notes>

		<description>We are in the sixties. John Miller, Terry Fields, Steve Bilander and Curt Menderson are four friends who have reached the border between adolescence and true youth. The most important thought for them is to have a girlfriend in the evening, but of course there is no rose without thorns. Between bravado, enthusiasm for life, vaunted maturity and much more sincere clumsiness, their expectations and insecurities are tested by a series of situations that find their crown in the most classic of car duels.</description>
		<notes>Between adolescent nostalgia and an already very seasoned directorial profession, George Lucas inaugurates a trend of fundamental importance in the American cinema of the following years. Mythical soundtrack.</notes>

		<description>Nando Moriconi (Alberto Sordi) has a dream: to be American. He denies pasta for strange concoctions, he doesn't miss a Hollywood film, he speaks a strange idiom that would like to be Americanizing. Parents no longer tolerate him, friends make fun of him, but he continues undeterred. When he climbs the Colosseum, the American consul is willing to intercede, but then recognizes him as the madman who had driven him off the road some time before and changes his mind.</description>
		<notes>It is the film that consecrated Sordi's talent, as well as building an immortal icon, that of the Italian seduced by American models, which he apes, however confirming his provinciality: some jokes remain famous, such as the American self-definition of Kansas City "repeated to the point of obsession and like those, equally famous, pronounced in the scene at the table, struggling with spaghetti.</notes>

Lisa, to take revenge, makes both her lover and her husband and Carla's son fall in love with herself, before returning to Paolo.</description>

		<description>Daisy Gamble (Barbra Streisand), an ugly girl who is complicated by the habit of smoking, entrusts herself to the care of a psychoanalyst, Dr. Marc Chabot (Yves Montand). These, through hypnosis, reach the deepest layers of his psyche. He discovers that Daisy was a beautiful lady of the nineteenth century, with whom the doctor falls in love. The film is based on a well-known musical comedy and has some merit only in the direction of the specialist Minnelli and in the professional interpretation of the Streisand / Montand couple. In the younger part of the half-brother, a mad musician, we find a young Jack Nicholson not yet risen to the role of star.</description>

		<description>Disembarked in Turin for work, the young Roman Clelia meets Rosetta in dramatic circumstances (the girl has in fact just attempted suicide for love) and later her friends, variously involved in critical sentimental events that seem to deal with the utmost ease. The ease that Rosetta lacks: she will try to take her own life a second time. Clelia, at first inclined to stop in Turin, returns to Rome.</description>
		<notes>Based on a story by Pavese, despite some fragmentation, the film shows us an Antonioni already master of the tools of the trade and keen observer of the difficulties of human relationships. Silver Lion in Venice.</notes>

		<description>Richard and Paula, young, beautiful, in love, have been working together for years as screenwriters. He wants to marry her, she is hesitant but lets himself be persuaded: as soon as they are married they begin to quarrel, thanks to the visits to their respective parents which turn out to be a failure. They break up. They will meet again to finish a screenplay locked in a room by the producer: the work will bring them together.</description>
		<notes>When the couple breaks out, comedies or tragedies are born. Norman Jewison chooses the first solution. The result is a bitter comedy, even if a little flat, about the problems of the couple and marriage. The interpretations are colorless.</notes>

		<description>Arnold is a young gay man who earns his living singing dressed as a woman in a New York nightclub. He falls in love with a teacher, Ed, but he doesn't want to admit his homosexual tendencies. Another young man, Alan, accepts a relationship with him. The two spend six happy years, but one day Alan is killed by a group of thugs.</description>
		<notes>It is one of the first films intended for the general public in which the homosexual issue is treated with great care and sensitivity, also involving actors of a certain resonance. There is talk of marginalization, of denied affections, of families turning their backs.</notes>

When he is transferred, Mario gets permission from his parents to host his friend. Then the friendship breaks down for trivial reasons and the two split up.</description>
		<notes>Despite appearances it is not a dull film, but is told by Franco Rossi with sobriety and almost never slipping into the pathetic. The two kids are still the best actors in the cast. Andrea Sciré was the son of the commander Valerio Borghese.</notes>

		<description>The film consists of six episodes, each with its own title: mafia, banditry, sport and tourism, racketeering, drugs and kidnappings, espionage and counter-espionage, historical-comic compromise, taken from as many feature films by the famous couple. The film sought to commercially exploit the newfound unity among comedians, operated above all by television, after the two had gone into crisis after the era of the overwhelming cinematic successes of the golden days.</description>
		<notes>Absolutely colorless from a cinematic point of view, the film has a certain value in re-proposing the couple's classic sketches.</notes>

Television film directed by Lamont Johnson, based on the story of the real Ray Johnson, a redeemed criminal. The protagonist is the good Beau Bridges, less charming brother of the handsome Jeff.</description>

		<notes>Sixth episode of the Rohmerian series "Comedies and Proverbs". The subject of Rohmer's films is deliberately banal, everyday. What counts above all is the staging: the ineffable dialogues, the simplicity of the shots, the environments. With Rohmer, a sentimental comedy always turns into a fascinating philosophical digression.</notes>

		<description>Chris and Dennis are two rival cinema operators, absolutely unscrupulous. From China (where Chris shoots fake war scenes and sells them for real) to South America, the two don't mind using dirty tricks and shots below the belt. And in their midst is the beautiful Alma, whom Dennis sends flying in place of a precious cholera vaccine. Happy ending with marriage. Acid thirties comedy, staged at high speed by Clark "King" Gable and Myrna Loy. Great success of the time.</description>

But, despite the information provided, Rove fails to prevent reason of state from prevailing: George is shot.</description>

		<description>The story is well known: Hamlet, prince of Denmark, knows that his father was treacherously killed by his brother who usurped the throne and married his wife. Now Gertrude, Hamlet's mother, sits on the throne next to Claudius, her husband's murderer, and the young prince ponders revenge; to fulfill his plan he does not hesitate to sacrifice the love that the young Ophelia feels for him. The prince pretends to be mad and the young woman suffers from it until she dies. Meanwhile, the tragedy looms over the throne of the usurpers and is unleashed when wandering actors arrive at the palace: Hamlet makes them stage a drama that traces his family history. Revenge will be inexorable, like a storm, and will lead everyone to the grave, including the avenger. Franco Zeffirelli signs, with this umpteenth version of Shakespearean Hamlet, a work of vast spectacle, relying on proven actors such as the English Alan Bates and the American Glenn Close, in the roles of the reigning usurpers and choosing for the part of the protagonist the Australian Mel Gibson, used to playing adventurous characters.</description>

Once the mission is completed, Clyde has to contend with Lynch, a southern captain, determined to intercept the swag.</description>
		<notes>Enzo G. Castellari (alias Girolami), an expert in action made in Italy, creates a funny and violent spaghetti western. Unfortunately mortified by the disproportionate use of the zoom, typical of those years (even in auteur cinema). The Pasolinian Franco Citti is very despicable, giving a forced touch to the film.</notes>

His suspicion is that Debora Ann is the most beautiful girl in school and, to verify this, she gets help from Toni, her longtime friend. For strange reasons, Michael's mother and Debora's father also find the same letter and begin to suspect their spouses. Eventually the mystery unfolds.</description>
		<notes>The characters seem at first sight incapable of understanding, of wanting and of understanding on their own which side to put on a T-shirt. Too bad because the cast is not bad (especially Howell) and the direction, at times, seems less stupid than the protagonists of the story.</notes>

Instead, it is the star who conquers Francesca who, despite the maneuvers of a jealous colleague, in turn manages to break into the heart of the singer and to spend a romantic getaway with him in Venice. Then he dies, putting an end in a riot of tears (and songs) to this soap opera in a single episode.</description>

		<description>Marcello, a young writer from a noble but now impoverished family, falls in love with Anna, an aspiring actress known by chance. The difference in character of the two young people leads them to a continuous alternation of quarrels and reconciliation. In fact, Marcello is possessive and jealous at least as much as Anna is free and available for sentimental adventures. However, the love swing is destined to last longer.</description>
		<notes>The film is based on a novel by Ercole Patti who also collaborated on the screenplay, together with Ennio Flaiano. An unusually dramatic Risi and not without good psychological ideas.</notes>

		<description>Louise is a high school student who, on the eve of her sixteenth birthday, discovers that she is a descendant of a witch. After a first reaction of disbelief he realizes that he actually has powers. How to use them is not a problem: the first victim is the unbearable English teacher, the second is a handsome football player. Thanks to the magic, Louise has no trouble becoming his girlfriend. The pretext, already quite abused, runs out quickly. In reality it is not a film, it is a shapeless thing that is halfway between "A witch in heaven" and "Cinderella". Without the merits of either of them.</description>

		<description>In Paris, at the end of the nineteenth century, Charles Swann (Jeremy Irons), a wealthy bourgeois art expert, enters into a relationship with Odette Crécy (Ornella Muti), a woman of the world. Swann suffers this love and the jealousy that derives from it as if it were a disease from which he will be able to heal only by marrying her. It is incredible that Schlöndorff himself managed to bring Proust to the screen after the failed attempts of Visconti, Ophuls, Losey, Resnais, among others. He puts all his good will into it, Nykvist (the director of photography) all his art, Irons and Delon everything possible, but the result is poor.</description>

		<description>Four episodes to describe the changes in customs in Italy in the 1960s. A reporter might marry a tycoon's daughter, but he prefers an affair with a married woman. A lawyer gives up his lover out of avarice, while a soldier tries the approach by train with a widow. Finally, a German couple in search of adventures misses the point, but finds love again.</description>
		<notes>Four episodes taken from as many short stories signed by Soldati, Moravia, Patti and Calvino should lash the costume of the Italians, but the literary origin is too strong and makes the film tiring. The best episode is that of the train, directed by Manfredi.</notes>

Naturally, man will do everything to prevent this landscape "destruction".</description>

		<description>Three episodes. The rest shifts of a waiter in the dining car and his girlfriend do not coincide: a "designed" to meet has grotesque results. The love of Renato and Maria is opposed by her brother, but above all by the libertinage of the aspiring boyfriend. Luisa is mute, Paolo loves her madly, commits an imprudence and ends up in jail.</description>
		<notes>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the "fashion" of episodic films spread. Except in very rare cases, the sum of several talents did not bring results equal to the premises. Here too we are faced with a product without infamy and without glory. The professionalism of the interpreters cannot spare a few yawns.</notes>

		<description>They pretend to be husband and wife, but in reality they are British agents who have arrived in Switzerland to suppress an enemy pawn. A man mistaken for an enemy agent is killed by mistake, then the real target is spotted. The film is based on a Campbell Dixon comedy inspired by two short stories by Somerset Maugham. Hitchcock works here, as usual, on one of his favorite themes, the exchange of identity. Excellent Peter Lorre in the part of the "general".</description>

Finally, a seductive widow hooks mourners to the cemetery to steal money from them.</description>

		<description>A beautiful anthropologist has collected, during a journey that lasted many years in all the most remote areas of the planet, a detailed documentation on the erotic customs of primitive populations. The material is shown during a congress that takes place in a hotel. The two waiters Franco and Ciccio secretly assist and demonstrate to the scholar that primitive erotic attitudes can occur even among the most advanced populations. Franco, Ciccio and the super-majored Jayne Mansfield interpret only the connecting scenes, for the rest the film is only a modest assemblage of mediocre documentaries a la Mondo cane.</description>

		<notes>From the director of _Breve incontro_ and _Lawrence d'Arabia_, a mélo inspired by a truly happened story. Overall a well-made and compelling work, with the performers all up to the role.</notes>

		<description>Jealous of her husband, director of a large industrial company and therefore always too busy with work, Elvira Kent pretends to leave for the Caribbean and sends Georgina, a young singer in her place. Jealous of his wife, Michael has her stalked in the Caribbean by Virgil, a private investigator who has the task of watching over her. Passion blossoms between the singer and the investigator, until everyone finds themselves in Rio De Janeiro.</description>
		<notes>The director and the writers, the same of "Casablanca", would have preferred Judy Garland, then they were satisfied with the newcomer Doris Day who, in order not to contradict herself, sings "It's Magic" and "Put'em 'a Box".</notes>

		<description>In the wild surroundings of a Scottish village, a beautiful and mysterious gypsy wanders helping the poor. The young Protestant pastor recently assigned to the care of local souls falls in love with him. A huge scandal arises, aroused by prejudice of class and race, so much so that the shepherd risks being lynched by the crowd of right-thinking villagers. But everything turns out for the best, with the discovery of the girl's true origins.</description>
		<notes>Richard Wallace alternates the dramatic tones with the sentimental ones, and makes a film that, more than sixty years after its release, remains exciting. Katharine Hepburn, in the cinema for only two years, is already a great actress.</notes>

		<description>Football star Gavin Gray (Dennis Quaid) marries beauty queen Babs Rogers (Jessica Lange). Between one sporting triumph and another, four children are born. Time passes and Babs is emancipated by opening a bar with the help of Edward, a giant friend who is later killed for debt. At sunset, lazy, Gavin doesn't notice a Babs fling. After leaving football, she is a golf instructor while she, always in love with her husband, becomes a career woman. A very conventional film of good feelings, the work of a director who, making his debut in 1982 with an Officer and a Gentleman, had given hope for many other developments.</description>

		<description>An all-black monster comes out of the canals of Amsterdam and kills people at full blast. At least that's what the only witness in the first murder tells Inspector Eric Visser, in charge of the case. Visser begins the search and almost immediately catches the culprit, but the man covered in the diving suit continues to elude him until the last moment.</description>
		<notes>It is a variant of the "Phantom of the stage", but the change of air, or rather of water, makes it almost original. The chase with motorboats launched at high speed through the narrow city canals is beautiful. Dick Maas ("The Flodders Are Coming", "The Elevator") has a trade.</notes>

		<description>The lawyer Biegler does not have a great professional reputation and yet one day a woman calls him: her husband, Lieutenant Manion, is accused of murder. She claims that the murderer was about to rape her, but the version has many dark sides. Where is the truth? Biegler engages in a very difficult process: he wins it, but the doubts remain.</description>
		<notes>Preminger makes an excellent film on the inextricable relationship between justice, truth, innocence and cunning and gives us an enigma that can only be considered solved only in appearance. The staging of ambiguity is subtle and careful: in the end we have no answers, questions remain. Intact.</notes>

Thus begins a ménage of four where everyone thinks they are betraying someone else, but in which no betrayal is ever consummated.</description>
		<notes>Based on the successful comedy by W. Douglas Home and M. Gilbert Sauvajon, the film by Luciano Salce, then a veteran of the success of Fantozzi, is an ugly series of clichés. Not even Ugo Tognazzi manages to save the hut.</notes>

		<description>Jack Cates, San Francisco police inspector with a not exactly docile and rather violent character, has long been on the trail of a drug kingpin who calls himself Iceman. During a gunfight with a group of Iceman's goons, Cates kills one. And from that moment the troubles begin for the policeman. In fact, the evidence that the murdered hitman was actually armed and dangerous disappears during the investigation. The inspector is therefore immediately suspended from service. To prove his innocence, however, he is given a chance: he has 48 hours to find Iceman and thus avoid prosecution for first degree murder. Jack has an important card to play that could help him resolve the dire situation in no time. The inspector thus turns, once again, to Reggie Hammond, the black thug who had already helped him solve a case seven years earlier. Hammond is in turn in Iceman's sights and therefore has a vested interest in helping Jack, before being stuffed with lead.</description>
		<notes>In fact about seven years earlier Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte had already found themselves fighting, running and shooting in "48 hours". This sequel isn't worth the first movie, but the two leads are always fantastic. Especially for the intensity of the actions that take place at a fast pace.</notes>

Instead, Wiley decides to move into the trailer, parked at the school. Meanwhile, Sam also has his sentimental pussies to fiddle with; it will all end well, of course. The cast is highly respected when it comes to stardom of the names, but Don Johnson's choice as a construction contractor is a bit perplexing. Tak Fujimoto is in photography, a certainty: he is Jonathan Demme's trusted man. Overall, everything is "pleasantly" predictable.</description>

		<description>Having moved to the United States for some years to make films, director Louis Malle took advantage of his stay to carry out an investigation among the immigrants who come to America every day, coming from five continents. What do they bring to Americans' culture and way of life? How do they fit? How does coexistence work? Contradictory answers, all implied by the desire to find in the Great Country that happiness that is not considered possible at home: some ironic, others sad, others surprising. A real ethnological documentary, signed by one of the most famous French directors.</description>

		<description>The tragic story of Andrei Rublëv, a Russian painter of the fifteenth century, is intertwined with that of Boriska, the son of a bell ringer, who claims to have learned from his father, on his deathbed, all the secrets for building bells. Actually the boy doesn't know anything, but the bell finally rings ...</description>
		<notes>Even to make films there are no "secrets", Tarkovskij's immense talent is enough.</notes>

		<description>Lenka lives with her little brother Miscia, a five-year-old blind boy in a town in the Yugoslav province. The Orthodox mother died while the father, a Jewish primary school teacher, was arrested at the time of the German occupation. Interned in a concentration camp, he is officially given up for dead. But Ratko, Lenka's father, has returned home and is forced to hide in the house.</description>
		<notes>Inhomogeneous and deliberately "authorial" film. Six people took part in the adaptation and the script. Geraldine Chaplin's debut on the big screen. The song "Oltre la notte" by Ivan Vandor is sung by Iva Zanicchi.</notes>

Scientists spot a deadly extraterrestrial living cell.</description>

The private cop discovers that Johnny has been discharged from a psychiatric clinic with the complicity of a heroin addict doctor. During the investigation four people die and the corpses show horrific mutilations. The door of truth, for Angel, opens onto the abyss.</description>
		<notes>Parker grappling with film noir openly points to allegory: Evil and Good are embodied in Lucifer and the Angel. Mickey Rourke flounders and De Niro eats it in one bite. A film that was overrated at the time.</notes>

When a homicidal maniac kills his closest "life" friends, the girl spots him and eliminates him.

		<description>A homeless girl has a daughter who lives in Spain. She is about to marry an aristocrat and thinks of coming to visit her mother together with the betrothed. A gangster decides to help the old woman, making her pass for a great lady. He even manages to convince the commissioner to join the plan and he really mobilizes high society for representation, which in this way succeeds very well. Last film by Frank Capra and remake of his "Lady for a day" (1933). Certainly it is less moving than the first, but still successful, also thanks to a great Bette Davis. Promising Debut for Ann-Margret; a secondary role for the still young Peter Falk.</description>

		<description>Being a worker in a dispenser, mistreated and poorly paid, does not satisfy the young poet. So, when a group of motorcyclists with their roaring choppers pass by, Poeta doesn't think twice and joins them. But the apparent freedom of that group instead hides a total dedication to the boss who mistreats women and proves to be violent and moody. Poet clashes with him and unwittingly causes his death. Then he leaves the group and looks for a job again. One of the many films of motorcyclists in America in crisis due to the Vietnam war; shortly after the message will become pacifist with Easy Rider in which we will find Jack Nicholson.</description>

Anna, to avoid a sure death in a duel to her beloved, sacrifices her feelings and marries the noble.</description>

		<notes>Little story suitable for minors and an audience with easy tears, shot for television and cleverly based on the authentic presence of John Paul II, whose visit to South America was exploited by making him appear in a sequence of the film. Among the performers, the Mexican Veronica Castro, known in Italy for the telenovela "Even the rich cry".</notes>

		<description>Biography of the New Zealand poet and novelist Janet Frame, followed in this film from childhood until the age of 35. Extremely shy and awkward, she is unable to bond with people, and her "strange" behavior even leads her to hospitalization in an asylum, where she will remain for eight years; literary accolades for her first book will save her from lobotomy.</description>

		<description>The engineer Guido Carani had a son from his relationship with Luisa who then took the vows: the son died. Obsessed with this story, Guido contemplates divorcing his wife, but she and her daughter die in an accident. Years later Guido falls in love with Lina, a girl who resembles Luisa in an extraordinary way. Lina dies in prison after giving birth to a son. The film is regarded as the ideal sequel to "Nobody's Children". Matarazzo expands the usual subject matter of melodrama towards horizons that border on the fantastic and the unreal, passing through the theme of the splitting of the personality and the returning past.</description>

And the two, the man of the law and the girl who applies her own code of death, work from now on in full and mutual agreement.</description>

		<description>In a bad place in New Orleans, the commander of a freighter, Frank, saves the enterprising Roxy from jail. The same night she repays him by robbing him and taking flight in the company of Linda, a widow with an infant, who dies while traveling. Roxy then introduces herself to the little boy's rich grandparents pretending to be the daughter-in-law they had not yet met. Everything seems to go smoothly, but Frank reappears. Modest work by Sidney Salkow, who arrived in Hollywood in the 1930s from a series of Broadway directing. The protagonist is a super star of the moment, the exotic Yvonne De Carlo, to whom Rock Hudson not yet established is only a shoulder.</description>

		<notes>Nice "gothic" melodrama by George Cukor. The morbid atmosphere that little by little insidiously envelops Ingrid Bergman is built with great elegance and effectiveness; involvement is guaranteed. Bergman (who won the Oscar for this interpretation) is really good: she manages to express the disorientation and then the panic of her character with such accents of truth, as to communicate to the viewer a condition of true anguish.</notes>

		<description>Two twin sisters, Pat and Ketty, are in love with the same man who eventually marries Pat. During a boat trip Pat dies by drowning, Ketty replaces her and wins the love of Bill. A great Bette Davis plays two parts in this comedy (of which she was also a producer) directed with the usual nocturnal and impenetrable taste by Curtis Bernhardt.</description>

		<description>Sister Angela, a novice waiting to pronounce solemn vows, was left alone on an abandoned island in the Pacific. Corporal Allison disembarks here in search of refuge and shortly afterwards a Japanese detachment also sets up its base there. The corporal and the novice find refuge in a cave and begin a "two" life marked by mutual correctness despite the bizarre situation. Allison eventually gives in to the call of the senses, but Sister Angela's reaction brings him back to himself. When the Americans finally arrive, the two will have learned to respect and really respect each other. A sensual and ironic, profound and adventurous film, supported by two extraordinary protagonists and an inspired John Huston: an exemplary clash between passion and vocation, a painful but rigorous ending.</description>

		<description>In the very distant future, man has returned from where he started, that is, a monkey has returned. At the University of Buffalo, Professor Orango and Professor Scimmia show their students a prehistoric film set at the end of the twentieth century. The film tells the involution of man from human to monkey and tells the story of a safari organized by a scientist and his beautiful assistant.</description>
		<notes>Steno's last film, born Stefano Vanzina, who had quite a few distribution problems. A distracted and listless Donald Pleasence was also involved in the "tragic" enterprise.</notes>

		<description>Baron Tolomeo de 'Tolomei is in trouble: if he does not marry his cousin within a certain day, the inheritance he is entitled to risks going as a gift to a clinic for crazy animals. The baron, among other problems, has a jealous girlfriend who does not give up a hand, but also has an ace up his sleeve: a double named Totò who will help him resolve the situation.</description>
		<notes>It is Totò's second film, after "Fermo con le mani", but it is already a revelation. The subject was by Achille Campanile and this explains passages of absolute surrealism in which the young face of the future prince De Curtis is at ease as in an abstract painting.</notes>

A young widow joins a small group of veterans and helps them, gently but also firmly, to reintegrate into society. He will fall in love with one of them.</description>
		<notes>Accompanied by a musical motif that airs Chopin's "Polonaise", the film takes up with dignity the themes of the best known "The best years of our life" except to slip into a slightly weak ending. However, the interpreters are excellent.</notes>

		<description>Helen Keller is a blind and deaf-mute child, the daughter of wealthy people from the Southern States at the beginning of the century who entrusted her to a first-time educator. She, Anne Sullivan, had herself been re-educated in a special institution. The little girl is unfriendly, resentful, and establishing contact with her is a desperate undertaking, but her educator does not give up.</description>
		<notes>It is a moving, painful film, with very strong scenes of violence and cruel clashes between the two personalities. The educator is a superb Anne Bancroft (awarded with the Oscar), who manages to totally involve the viewer and make him participate in her exhausting effort to communicate with this very difficult child.</notes>

		<description>Widowed, Anna Owens lands in Bangkok with her son to take on the task of looking after the education of the despotic sovereign's children. Although at the cost of hard clashes with the latter, he manages to influence his politics by encouraging him in the work of modernizing the country. He will leave Siam following the accidental death of his son. Based on the book written by Margaret Landon about a character who lived in the nineteenth century, the film was a huge success backed by two Oscars (for photography and set design). A little bit easy exoticism, but great performance of the performers.</description>

		<description>The difficult relationship between two sisters, Juliane and Marianne, dates from their adolescence. One is a journalist, the other is in a maximum security prison because he is a terrorist. The respective choices have distant roots and mix private issues (the relationship with the family and the severe father, a Protestant pastor) and public (Germany's Nazi past). At the news of her sister's suicide in prison, the reporter is not satisfied with the official version, but the evidence of the political murder no longer interests a distracted public opinion eager only to forget. In an admirable balance of feelings and despair, Von Trotta develops an emblematic story which, in the moment in which she resumes the news (the death in prison of the terrorist Gudrun Esslin), manages to sublimate it in a reflection that touches universal chords. The performers are of rare effectiveness, with the two protagonists above all. It is no coincidence that the title of this film has become a commonly used expression. Golden Lion in Venice.</description>

		<description>De Francesco, a modest professor who arrived in Rome from Sicily, wants to find work as a representative of a pharmaceutical company. The long process to obtain the necessary authorizations makes him discover the intrigues of the bureaucracy. Fired for inefficiency, he becomes secretary of a politician and takes care of his electoral campaign. He works so well that he ends up ... in jail in place of his shady boss.</description>
		<notes>Six years after "Difficult years", Zampa still hits the mark. Thanks also to the literary trace of Brancati (subject and scneggiatura had the Natro d'Argento, as well as Nino Taranto). Neorealism, however, turned inexorably towards "pink".</notes>

One of them falls in love with the mother of a companion and sends her flowers, which she believes were sent by the boy's father. The first flirtations take place at the cinema and the summer colony will finally bring love.</description>
		<notes>Childhood is one of the favorite themes of Truffaut, who here simply chooses to deal with the daily life of the young protagonists. With the same pleasure experienced in front of "The 400 shots" and "The wild boy", we find the freshness and respect that drives away any sweetness.</notes>

And his political faith falters.</description>

As soon as they arrive in Gallipoli, near the Dardanelli Strait, they are sent to the massacre together with their fellow soldiers.</description>

		<description>A post-atomic Texas is the setting for the struggle for survival between opposing factions: on the one hand the daughter of a scientist with the secret to a deadly weapon. On the other, a band of desert marauders well-intentioned to catch her. Pursuits and duels to the death in a dusty, indefinite and yet clearly false context. At a certain point some mercenaries also come up and for once they choose to take sides on the right side.</description>
		<notes>Kevin Mancuso = Joe D'Amato = Aristide Massaccesi; George Eastman = Luigi Montefiori. In a nutshell: very Italian, artisanal production, but with some good ideas and the typical "pioneering" spirit of D'Amato &amp; Co. The film is inspired by the western "I cinque della vendetta" by Aldo Florio, best known as the director of "A life sold" (taken from Sciascia). Michele Soavi, author of "Dellamorte Dellamore", participates instead in the operation as assistant director. Not recommended for fine palates, but lovers of the post-atomic vein will find bread for their teeth.</notes>

		<description>The bounty hunter Henry Stark must cross a vast and desolate expanse to reach, together with his prisoner, the city of Neon City. There you will be able to claim the prize. The territory that the two must cross is fraught with danger: attacks by criminal mutants and the presence of a lethal toxic cloud. They are joined by a small group of stragglers and the adventure begins.</description>
		<notes>It is not difficult to see a distant reference to the adventures of Mad Max: the ruins of a post-technological history of risky nomadism are not exactly a novelty in the cinema. But one can always console oneself by admiring Vanity's graces.</notes>

		<description>The apes have now conquered the Earth and men are reduced to semi-slavery. While the head of the community, Caesar, assisted by the sage Virgilius, pursues a peaceful coexistence with humans, for the history of which he has a strong interest, the gorilla Aldus has only the purpose of gaining power for himself by eliminating any obstacle. The discovery of a small community of men who have escaped enslavement unleashes a violent battle.</description>
		<notes>The film takes advantage of the now lifeless vein inaugurated by the "Planet of the Apes" and tries to give itself a tone by bothering the sacred monsters of Rome for the names of its heroes, but it is a little bit. In fact it will be the last of the series.</notes>

She seems to be persuaded by the unknown, but the game remains open ....</description>
		<notes>The French director and writer Alain Resnais has undoubtedly made a difficult, intellectualistic and provocative film, which pushes us to penetrate with our eyes its ambiguous substance, as mysterious as the magical place of action pervaded by the ghosts of the past.</notes>

Until she realizes she is trapped in a game bigger than her.</description>
		<notes>Discreet thriller supported by a couple of excellent actors. The story looks like that of an episode of "Diabolik" but the twists are not desired. Beverly D'Angelo, in life, is the wife of Al Pacino.</notes>

		<description>A group of Japanese scientists must reach their base in the Antarctic region. Adversed by the terrible weather conditions, they are forced to make a sudden retreat. The small plane that came to their rescue, however, is unable to board even their pack of sled dogs, which thus remain abandoned on the pack ice. Thus begins the struggle for survival in the long polar winter. Films for dog lovers and cinephiles: the former find there a moving, but never pathetic adventure in the wildest nature; the latter, a good storytelling of events, highly spectacular photography and a good soundtrack.</description>

		<description>Young daughter of Roman nobles, Ippolita has been semi-paralyzed for years. Convinced of the psychic origin of the problem, a psychiatrist thinks he can solve it with the weapons of science. A family picture comes to light characterized by oedipal and incestuous relationships, but that is not enough: the girl must be freed from the devil.</description>
		<notes>Obviously inspired by "The Exorcist", a Trastevere horror that hangs out in the well-known and tries to plug the flaws in the script with splatter effects. The patriarchal-Vatican setting is not surprising, the exorcist friar looks like a speck. Better, by the same author, "Holocaust 2000".</notes>

		<description>The customs, traditions and problems of the people of a small village in the Gargano in the sixties, those of the economic and demographic boom. Scenes of everyday life for a documentary shot in a depressed country at the time when the Italian economy was growing dramatically and when everyone thought more about spending than saving.</description>
		<notes>It is a little seen and decidedly unique film on the national cinema scene. A work against the tide not only in the ideological setting and in the choice of subject, but also in the stylistic approach to the documentary genre. To realize this idea, the director, who in 1954 directed "I found my son" and in 1969 will direct "The discovery", did everything by himself, including photography and editing, living a year in the filming locations and shooting everything with the shoulder machine. The film was awarded the Leone di San Marco plaque at the Venice Film Festival and is commented by a voiceover entrusted to Riccardo Cucciolla.</notes>

		<description>Dadaism and Surrealism are two avant-garde movements developed mainly in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s. Many artists - painters, poets, photographers - adhering to the two schools made short films without plot, based mainly on associations of images and ideas, often aimed at scandal. The proposed anthology consists of seven films lasting between six and forty minutes. The titles, in order, are: Retour à la raison, Emak Bakia and L'étoile de mer, by Man Ray, Anemic cinéma, by Marcel Duchamp, La coquille et le clergyman, by Germaine Dulac, Un chien andalou, by Luis Buñuel, Le ballet mécanique by Férnand Léger.</description>

The Scottish captain is approached by an unscrupulous adventurer dedicated to arms trafficking. The latter engages in a tough fight with Antonio who, however, has Placido as an ally, a candid "flower child" with an easy punch: the two will defeat the gang of bad guys. Genuinely naive show for families: if the model is that of the comical-grotesque couples like Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, with all their grandchildren, the result is fully achieved.</description>

Reproaches, abandonments, injuries, a bottle of arsenic and a final reconciliation follow. Amedeo Nazzari, in one way or another, is at home in the mines. As well as in the heart-breaking melodramas of which this is not even the most striking example. A brief role also for Isa Barzizza in the part of Ortensia Dupré, friend of Elena's heart.</description>

		<description>Caterina is a girl from Cremona traumatized by the disappearance of her father, who died at the Heysel stadium in Brussels during the tragic Juventus-Liverpool match, the final of the European Cup. Convinced that she can find her parent's killer, she goes to the English city. Ugly surprises await you.</description>
		<notes>Marco Tullio Giordana, director of the controversial (but interesting) "Pasolini an Italian crime", lingers too long with an effective but inconsistent script. The staging seems that of any "instant movie" and the civil commitment cannot mask the modesty of the operation. Too bad, the starting idea was good.</notes>

		<description>Walter, invited to an important business dinner, doesn't know who to go with and asks his brother for help: it's the classic blind date. The girl is called Nadia and she is surprisingly beautiful, but she has a small flaw: when she drinks, she loses all inhibitions. Walter doesn't think about it and immediately offers her some champagne. From that moment a long series of troubles began.</description>
		<notes>One of the masters of comedy gives his lesson "Blind Date" is certainly not Edwards' masterpiece, however the mechanism of gags, of misunderstandings, of the clash between the sexes. Typically Edwardsian the theme of alcohol, and which works as a litmus test for the characters' antics but also for their frustrations. Radiant Kim Basinger and not bad Bruce Willis, who after the serial "Moonlighting" seemed destined for a sure career in brilliant comedy.</notes>

		<description>An aspiring musician is on the verge of abandoning all ambitions. In fact, he is about to get married and become a business partner of his future father-in-law. To promise him salvation from this prosaic and frustrating prospect, a real angel with broken wings appears who, for this reason, has fallen into the young man's existence during his bachelor party. Fantasy comedy without art or part, despite the cast not entirely despicable: in particular, we refer to the presence of the good and beautiful Emmanuelle Béart ("A heart in winter", "The grumpy beauty"), evidently a young prey of promise Americans which, fortunately, she then escaped.</description>

		<description>Adelaide, a particularly beautiful young woman, is employed in a Florentine company where the rest of the staff are almost exclusively male. It is therefore inevitable that all her colleagues, bachelors and not, try to seduce her. Of all the luckiest seems to be Adelmo who, one day, even manages to snatch an appointment from her. However, things get complicated quickly due to the improvised Don Juan who has to overcome a series of obstacles to get to the appointment with Adelaide in time ... For some time Montagnani has been the "commuter of laughter" between the two fixed stars of eroticism local: Bouchet and Fenech.</description>

		<description>The discovery of a nuclear base in an enemy nation prompts the Americans and the Soviets to jointly promote an air mission to avert the danger of an atomic attack. Collaboration, however, is not easy due to the existing rivalries between the different crews. Things change only when it turns out that the mission is actually a cover, destined to fail, so that the high commands of the US and the USSR can unleash nuclear war on them, for grim calculations of power.</description>
		<notes>After the various "Rambo" and other films that in the 1980s marked the Reagan era with their action-packed anti-communism, this "Eagles of Attack" is perhaps the first to take note of a changed international reality (the " thaw "between the superpowers is upon us). Even if the whole plot is only a pretext for showing off the aerial acrobatics of unlikely Top Guns. "Iron Eagle", the original (in Italian "Aquila d'steo"), with music by Queen, was a notable success at the box office, and the sequel was a foregone conclusion. But the bad quality is missing. Louis Gossett jr is a slave to "his" character.</notes>

		<description>An ancient legend of the peoples beyond the Arctic Circle tells of how the sixteen-year-old Lapp warrior Aigin became a celebrated hero having saved his people from the terrible incursions of the ruthless Tsjude marauders, around the year one thousand. This film evokes his mythical deeds in the fascinating setting of a majestic and dramatic landscape, making a very young performer with an extraordinarily expressive gaze act. The use of the sober but extremely functional soundtrack is also very interesting. An unusual film, not only for its origin but for the strength of the narration and the splendor of the photography.</description>

An odyssey begins for these men that takes them from island to island in the Pacific Ocean, until they can be sent on their first real war mission. A Howard Hawks in great shape struggling with a story without great performers, or rather with many small heroes. A propaganda film, of course, but not without sudden personal flashes: in the course of this real quest for combat, Hawks even manages to place an excellent number of musicals.</description>

		<notes>The beginnings of the anti-Nazi resistance seen through the flaming glass of melodrama. Excellent interpretation of Ingrid Bergman and an incisive and effective direction.</notes>

		<description>A rather wild girl (Katharine Hepburn) is considered by her fellow villagers to be a kind of witch. The situation worsens when she kidnaps a child, even if she does it for a good purpose: we almost miss a lynching, but a doctor in love with her manages to save her. In the village, however, there is no future for her: the girl will have to leave. John Cromwell was primarily a director of melodramas and is also seen in this film, not too bright to tell the truth. The curiosity of the cinephile can however be satisfied by the presence of an almost rookie Hepburn conditioned, however, in a role that does not suit her characteristics very much.</description>

		<description>Jason goes in search of the Golden Fleece, on the orders of King Pelias. But he plots against him because the oracle says that Jason himself will kill him. The mythical hero still manages to fulfill his mission, even with the help of the gods and Medea, daughter of the king of Colchis. Taking possession of the Fleece, after killing the seven-headed Hydra, Jason will take Medea with him on the way back. Freely inspired by the myth of Jason, the film takes care of the point: how beautiful the adventure is. Ray Harryhausen's "naive" special effects (with the fight against skeletons) are a masterpiece, photography is a delight. Music by Bernard Herrmann. A small classic that boasts numerous enthusiasts.</description>

Among others: Godard turns in a gym of bodybuilders and Altman stages the nobles and poor people in the theater. The result is not too homogeneous, but at times brilliant.</description>

		<description>The misadventures of a clumsy country boy who turns into a tramp and goes to town. Erminio Macario, who also shares responsibility for the screenplay with the director, could also have chosen his debut film better.</description>
		<notes>The inspiration is vaguely Chaplinian with a series of gags that are more visual than words, but the reception of the critics (and above all that of the public) was not good. Macario himself did not keep a good memory of it, so much so that he swore to abandon the cinema to devote himself only to the magazine in which he had already become fairly famous. The sequel proves that he lied. In the cast a very young Laura Adani.</notes>

Suddenly, however, their tranquility is upset by a series of events, linked to a lost agenda, which bring about a change and put them in contact with each other. It's like testing yourself again.</description>
		<notes>A work built very well, ironic and bitter, despite some funny ideas and the lightness with which the topics are sometimes touched upon. The best film by Silvio Soldini, much appreciated author of "Pane e tulipani".</notes>

		<description>South Africa 1976. A black child is killed with others during an anti-apartheid demonstration. The child's father investigates the responsibilities, but is arrested and dies under torture. The widow has recourse to the white master of the murdered, Professor Ben, hitherto disinterested in politics and racial issues, who this time starts to attack the institutions to restore justice. Made with genuine resentment and a little flatness by a young Martinique director, Euzhan Palcy, who was inspired by a novel based on real events. Good performers, including a revived Marlon Brando.</description>

		<description>The car in which the young Paul was welcomed for a ride runs over a little girl; the driver is drunk, but his wife puts the responsibility for the accident on the boy. Prosecuted and convicted, Paul ends up in a prison where a kind of sadistic sport is practiced: the chase of inmates by trained and ferocious dogs. Prison films have always been a favorite occasion for Hollywood for civil commitment, for denouncing the cruelty and corruption that pollute penitentiary activities. Here is added the critique of the hairy respectability that throws the protagonist into the hell of detention.</description>

During one of these recruitments, Arizona Colt is also taken, a gunslinger who asks Gordon to think before accepting the urgent invitation. The meeting with the beautiful Jane, however, changes his life and pushes him to revenge.</description>

Nobody finds him very nice, except the village shepherd and the beautiful Jane, the grocery store clerk. However, when a cattle trader threatens to pass through the area with his herd, destroying all the crops, he will be the one to defend his fellow citizens and save the crops. Westerner less than a lesser director. Roy Rowland worked extensively for MGM, before directing "Arrivederci Roma" with Rascel and some western spaghetti. However, he had the good fortune to work with rather famous actors such as Stewart Granger and Rondha Fleming.</description>

His superiors flank him with black sergeant Roger Murtaugh, who is retired and reluctant to use weapons. Little by little, a frank camaraderie builds up between the two as they investigate a gang of drug traffickers ...</description>
		<notes>Perhaps the novelty of this film is that of having put two such different characters side by side, managing to make them get along. In addition, while remaining within the genre tracks, it broadens them with an ironic spectacle of violence.</notes>

		<description>In Los Angeles, the team of detectives formed by the "splashy" white Martin Riggs and the "wise" black Roger Murtaugh are tasked with protecting Leo Getz, the accountant of a drug dealer organization. But the gang that wants Leo's head has very high hooks, right down to a South African ambassador. Thus, Martin meets an embassy employee, the beautiful Rika van den Haas, with whom he has an intense love affair.</description>
		<notes>Humor and shootings confirm the main ingredients of the series, well mixed here. The choice of a South African villain arouses curiosity:? It was 1989 and with the Cold War officially over, American cinema was looking for new villains.</notes>

		<description>In October 1942, in German-occupied France, the leader of an underground group organized the flight to England of important people of the Resistance. In an attempt to save two comrades captured by the SS, the man gets caught in turn but manages to escape. He is informed that one of their companions is in the hands of the Gestapo. Will he resist torture? The only solution, however painful, is to eliminate it. It is a very hard, decidedly painful film about the dangers faced by the French partisans and above all about their difficult choices. The dry and nervous style, the threatening city environments, the interpretation (especially by Lino Ventura and a tragic Simone Signoret) make this Melville film a wonderful example of war 'noir'.</description>

But his grandfather, Cavaliere di Vittorio Veneto, remembers having already been within those walls many years ago, at the time of his youth ...</description>

		<description>In a small town in the United States, a newspaper changes ownership and some editors are fired. To take revenge for the dismissal, a young reporter inserts, in her latest column, a false letter from a hypothetical John Doe. In the letter, the man announces that, on Christmas night, he will throw himself from the skyscraper of the town hall to protest against the authorities. The film, also known as "The rulers of the metropolis" expresses in an exemplary way the sincere Roosveltian populism of Capra and his screenwriter Robert Riskin. Famous is the final scene of the convention (shot with seven cameras) with Cooper's evangelical tirade.</description>

		<description>Accomplice an employee, Sabata and Mangosta rob a bank, but Mangosta keeps everything, buys a ranch in Mexico and entrenches himself there with a few gunslingers. The two betrayed partners (Sabata and the employee) are not the only ones interested in recovering the loot.</description>
		<notes>Where such a bizarre name as Sabata came from is unknown. The fact is that together with Sartana (usually the latter played by Gianni Garko) he has long been one of the most used figures on the trash side of "spaghetti". Small films often embellished only by excellent stunts. Anthony Steffen, born, is Antonio De Teffè.</notes>

		<description>Ella Connors, who inherited a farm and pasture land from her father, rejects the purchase proposals of Erwin, the tyrant of the area. Having sold part of the pastures to two veteran cowboys, it is against them that Erwin sends his assassins. But Frank, one of the cowboys, survives and his help will be instrumental in Ella's fight against the despotic and criminal landowner.</description>
		<notes>The temporal collocation of the story is interesting (it later took place, however, in a fairly predictable way) in the second half of the 1940s, with the war against the villains of the house after that against the enemies of the homeland. The environment is optimally enhanced.</notes>

		<description>It is September 20, 1870: the Bersaglieri of General La Marmora enter Rome. A chain of private events (killings, loves, revenge) has as its background the fall of the temporal power of the popes, in a narrative that oscillates between the satirical, the sentimental and the grotesque.</description>
		<notes>That of "revisiting" the history of Italy is one of the basic matrices of Luigi Magni's cinema, with figures of full-bodied immediacy, a marked streak of bitterness and a predilection for a biting anticlericalism. But here, even with a valuable outline, the thematic core is rather fragile and far too "constructed". On the other hand, the performance of the actors is valuable.</notes>

		<description>A dentist father who enjoys being a radio amateur, a mother demonstrating housewares, two grandparents who are too young and a fourteen-year-old daughter already close to graduation, then there are two terrible twins, an uncle songwriter and a bodybuilder maid. It's a pretty original family: the situation gets worse when Mom wins a TV quiz. The prize consists in spending a weekend with a singer, with whom the woman falls in love. But when she decides to run away with the star ... twist! A film that mixes new cabaret and old Italian comedy: the result is disappointing.</description>

When all hope seems lost, Walter manages to recover a precious jewel that will heal the debts of the group and bring the loving couple closer together.</description>

		<description>In a college of Carmelite friars the boarder Julien befriends a Jewish boy, Bonnet, enrolled under a false name. It is 1944 and France is occupied by the Nazis. The bond created by the boys will be severed by the denunciation of a comrade, who, punished for having practiced the black market, decides to take revenge on the rector in this way, even though he knows that he will also involve the other college students. The Gestapo arrests the director of the school and all the Jewish boys who are hiding there.</description>

After Mortimer has discovered a corpse in a chest, the two candid young ladies confess to him without difficulty that they have already killed a dozen old men and buried them in the cellar with the collaboration of the foolish nephew Teddy. From the play of the same name by Joseph Kesselring Arsenic and old lace is one of the most famous works by Frank Capra, written in a state of grace and performed by an impeccable cast. The nice old killer ladies and the rhythm of their misdeeds show that Capra is not the "feel-good" director one would like to believe.</description>

		<description>Following the failure of the painting "The Night Watch", not understood by his contemporaries, and the immature loss of his wife, Rembrandt falls into a profound existential crisis. The love of a humble woman grants him a brief period of light before dark and disconsolate old age.</description>
		<notes>Genius of historical cinema and then producer of masterpieces of the fantastic, such as "The Thief of Baghdad" and "The Tales of Hoffmann", Alexander Korda signs with this "Rembrandt" a refined and captivating film. The tone is light, appropriate to the story of the momentary relief that the famous painter finds in his belated love.</notes>

		<description>Detective Linda Masterson is put in charge of the investigation into the murder of a rock star. What helps make the case singular is that the killer also disfigured his victim's face. From that moment other murders, all with the same characteristics, follow one another. Linda, aided by investigator Tarek Richards, senses that the killer uses an ancient martial art known as "Tiger claws". Straight from the bottom of the barrel, scraped with painstaking care, comes this other film with Cynthia Rothrock, warlike heroine of martial arts films. After China O'Brien and China O'Brien II they certainly did not miss them.</description>

		<description>Arturo Bach (Dudley Moore) apparently has only one problem: how to spend your money. Scion of a multibillionaire, he spends his days in restaurants, afternoons at racing and nights at night, waiting to get hold of his incredible fortunes. However, he has two small problems, which he has learned to live with: drinking and having to marry a silly girl, also the daughter of a billionaire, to inherit. But one day in a clothing store he notices and courts Linda, a modest saleswoman. Here is a film that even after twenty years confirms one of the qualities it had highlighted at the time: the great professionalism of American "medium" productions. Starting with two very concrete facts: the script and the acting. In the first case, even if the story is certainly not new, it is still modernized with brilliant verve. The second is highlighted for example in the exemplary duets between that sacred monster of acting that is Sir John Gielgud (who won the Oscar as a supporting character) and the new prince of laughter. Dudley Moore. Oscar also to the song.</description>

		<description>Abel Davos (Lino Ventura), who has committed crimes in various countries, tries to avoid capture and save his family. Entrusting himself to the young Raymond (Jean-Paul Belmondo), he realizes that the Parisian evil has abandoned him to his fate. More crimes, but then fatigue and surrender. It is the second feature film by Claude Sautet, a director who made his bones in action films but then followed more challenging roads, and we remember at least L'amante, from 1969, and the recent, beautiful A Heart in Winter. Remarkable control of the narrative material, very good direction of the actors, all very effective.</description>

		<description>David Linderby, a British doctor serving in West Africa on behalf of the UN, finds valuable help from his wife Anansa, who is also a medical graduate and a beautiful descendant of the Ashanti tribe. But Suleiman, a slave trader, kidnaps the woman and drags her, with other prisoners, to the shores of the Red Sea. David moves on their trail in an attempt to save his wife, with the help of Malik, who has an unfinished business with Suleiman. The enterprise ends with a bloody showdown. Wonderful photography, proven actors, landscapes of great suggestion, but the film is resolved in a very predictable cartoon. From a true story.</description>

		<description>The daughter of an Italian boss is about to marry the scion of another big hit, but a third gangster, to prevent the alliance between rival families, has her kidnapped. A case causes Wilson, a down-and-out New York investigator, and Miller, his worthy apprentice, to receive the assignment from the kidnapped to take a message to Rome, where they fly with blown tickets to two Japanese tourists. American bloodhounds fall into a series of dangerous situations, including rival gangs, murders, escapes on old "Cinquecento", misunderstandings with the police and mistaken identity. Breakneck gags, but not always right.</description>

A bricklayer friend of his "passes" him a small repair in the house of a beautiful lonely lady who gets mad at him and keeps him with her, covering him with gifts. However, the mason's eldest son takes it upon himself to bring things back to order and for this purpose he goes to the woman's house and convinces her to leave his father.</description>
		<notes>International cast for a not very exciting cinematic sketch. Even the actors are wasted by a very weak script. And to think that the book from which it is based, written by John Fante, is beautiful.</notes>

		<description>The criminologist Laurent Berman became famous with an essay entitled "Le hasard et la violence" which had a resounding success with the public and critics. Now Laurent is on the French Riviera where he divides his time between a well-deserved rest, work on his next book and his relationship with Dr. Constance Weber. Then a homicidal maniac takes care of his life.</description>
		<notes>A French thriller with Yves Montand and with pretensions. Unfortunately, the latter weigh more and the presence of the famous actor fails to lift the film from mediocrity. Philippe Labro's work was also distributed under the title "Love and violence".</notes>

		<description>Mysterious murders take place in a castle in the English countryside rented for the shooting of a film. It will be the infallible Miss Marple who will solve the puzzle. Miss Marple means Agatha Christie, the undisputed queen of yellow, with her perfect plots and her typically "Old England" settings.</description>
		<notes>To pay homage to such an authoritative name, many celebrities from the screen (perhaps a little aged) are gathered around the protagonist Angela Lansbury. The clash of the divine is fun, but the formula is now watered down.</notes>

		<description>Actress June Buckridge, who plays the part of a nun, Sister George in a TV series, is facing a downward trend that is now irreversible. When he learns that his character is about to be eliminated from the program, he goes into a depressive crisis. He begins to give himself to alcohol and to pay for it is Alice, the woman he lives with, moreover already used to the whims and jealousies of his partner.</description>
		<notes>Aldrich's proverbial cruelty is measured this time by a particularly hot topic at the time: female homosexuality. Without fear and without false modesty, the film also makes a ferocious satire of the television environments. Great interpretation by Beryl Reid.</notes>

		<description>Tom Thielman, police chief of a small Nebraska town, returns home to find his elderly mother dead, lying on the sofa. It is shortly after that Dad Louis approaches him and whispers "I killed her". At first Tom thinks it's just a guilt-based saying. But then the investigation gets complicated and Tom will be forced to take his father to prison and then to court. Great script by Lillian Samuel that does not let us glimpse the solution of the mystery if not at the last. Excellent duets between Lloyd and Beau Bridges, father and son also in life, therefore, respectively, father and brother of the more famous Jeff. The murdered mother is Beau's real mother and Lloyd's wife.</description>

Here, among the diverse fauna of the tenants, the murderer hides.</description>

But if Mrs Voorhes is now dead, who is it that is prowling, thirsty for blood, to defend their territory?</description>

		<description>During the Spanish Civil War, a Francoist garrison took refuge in the Alcazar, a military academy. The siege by the republican forces lasts a couple of months and ends only with the arrival of Franco's nationalists. Regardless of the indefensible political structure, it is a narratively not simple film, which arouses particular interest in the curious mixture of different genres (the war film declined in bourgeois drama). He won the Mussolini Cup at the Venice Film Festival.</description>

		<description>Chuck Tatum is a low-key reporter who hasn't stopped looking for the lucky shot. The scoop comes in the form of an ancient Indian cave in which Leo Mimosa was half-buried. It will be enough to delay the rescue and the case will soon reach the front pages. Eventually Chuck repents, but it's too late for everyone. In fact, no one is saved in the film. Neither Chuck, cynical even at the moment of death, nor Leo's wife who, when asked by the photographers to pretend to pray, replies "Kneeling spoils the stockings". One of the most bitter and merciless films on mass media cynicism. Exciting and prophetic, one of Wilder's masterpieces.</description>

		<description>Desmond Spellacy (Robert De Niro), secretary of the archbishop of his diocese, is sensitive to the fascination of power, even if exercised in the priest's cassock. His brother Tom (Robert Duvall) is a cop who does his duty, but he is not immune to less than honorable compromises. The murder of a prostitute puts the priest in conflict with the powerful and the "cop" who investigates the crime.</description>
		<notes>Apparently, it could be called a thriller, but it is instead a well-constructed film on the dramatic inadequacy to live two different demanding "missions". Robert De Niro and Robert Duvall equal merit in a challenge between great protagonists.</notes>

		<description>In Gaul subjugated by the Romans only the village of Asterix resists the invader. A centurion decides to kidnap the druid Panoramix, holder of the secret of the potion that makes the Gauls invincible, but in doing so the druid is hit in the head and loses his memory. A false fortune-teller appears in the village who, in league with the Romans, tries to persuade the Gauls to leave the village. The result is pleasant, especially for the funny characteristics of the characters and the teasing of the Roman usurpers. Obelix who launches his menhirs as if they were rockets fired from a cannon is the most fun. Based on the famous comic by Goscinny and Uderzo.</description>

		<description>It is a marine documentary that in a fairytale form takes us back to the mystery of the legendary continent that disappeared among the ocean waters. Underwater life is the exclusive protagonist: fish, all the marine fauna and, in particular, dolphins are at the center of Luc Besson's attention. No words of comment: only images, sometimes suggestive, sometimes a little less, and the music composed for the occasion by Eric Serra (but there is also an aria from the "Sonnambula" sung by Callas). The film, made after the fictional feature film "Le grand bleu", lasts just over an hour and a quarter: and maybe that's too much.</description>

		<notes>Some for emotional reasons, some for thirst for money, some for aesthetic fascination, all the characters have the statuette as their driving force. A good idea to start with, but the brilliance of the story sometimes tarnishes. On the other hand, the interpreters are excellent.</notes>

		<description>Daniela leaves the province to spend a day in Rome. It so happens that the girl misses the return bus and is thus forced to spend the night in an attic under construction. From that moment on, he will stay in the capital and meet various men, all disappointing, except the last one, the owner of the penthouse.</description>
		<notes>An interesting comedy that reflects on the material "values" of Italy in the boom. For the protagonist, the attic becomes the goal of life and a certain tension in the film makes the metaphor credible. Perhaps Puccini's best work, certainly aided by a sparkling cast. Tomas Milian stands out above all.</notes>

		<description>At the Welton Academy, an elitist New England college, in the fall of 1959 a new literature teacher arrives, John Keating, who immediately stands out for his pedagogical methods that are absolutely unusual for the times and for the institute: with gestures to blatant times instills in students a love of true poetry and, above all, great confidence in their intellectual means. The situation degenerates when one of the boys, Neil, dominated by an authoritarian father, collides with the austere family to act as an actor.</description>

		<description>We are in 2084 and for the muscular worker Doug Quaid the obsession is only one: to go to Mars. In addition to normal scheduled travel, there are also companies such as Recall capable of implanting in the memory of their customers the memory of vacation weeks spent on the red planet. Doug turns to Recall and there the trouble begins because the technicians discover that something is wrong with his head. In fact, Doug actually was on Mars as a secret agent, and his current life as a worker is nothing more than a false memory.</description>
		<notes>The film is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, "Total Memory", more complex and fascinating than the cinematographic reduction. However "Act of Force" boasts the intelligent work of directing. Amazing special effects: Schwarzenegger hidden in the guise of an irascible lady stranded on the Martian frontier is an image that is already in the annals of science fiction.</notes>

		<description>From Milan, where the powerful Soviet general Marenkov, who was a spy for the United States, asked for political asylum, the American colonel Harry Wargrave must transfer his bulky colleague to Rotterdam. Beyond Curtain, the KGB has instructed Nikolai Bunin to kill the traitor. On the train that crosses Switzerland, Germany and Holland, a ruthless and no-holds-barred fight is unleashed around Marenkov.</description>
		<notes>Unfortunately the film is overloaded and stereotyped for its genre. He was the last played by Robert Shaw and the last also for director Mark Robson. A half failure despite the waste of resources and the script by Abraham Polonsky.</notes>

Some of the survivors, obeying the commander, remain in the hall, others follow a combative priest towards the keel, not yet swallowed. The former all die, but there will also be numerous victims among the others.</description>
		<notes>Among the earliest examples of the catastrophic trend, the film makes use of excellent sets (the claustrophobic tunnels of the ship reconstructed upside down) and award-winning special effects. The characters, however, outlined in strong colors, end up being caricatured, and their drama involuntarily grotesque.</notes>

		<description>Three French thugs and two Italians are looking for new ways to make a living from crime. The kidnapping of famous people seems to give good results: the singer Johnny Halliday, a Swiss ambassador, a South American general. Falling into the hands of justice, the five, elected as a symbol of the protest, are released by popular acclaim. Having fled to Africa, they will dedicate themselves to their most ambitious undertaking: kidnap the Pope.</description>

His skill in action roles convinces an emir to kidnap him and involve him in a coup attempt against the legitimate ruler of a small, very oil-rich state. However, the singer organizes a strange nucleus of loyalists by enlisting all the thieves in the area and with this collectible army he defeats the coup leaders.</description>

Certainly not among the best proofs of the great Polish author - who between the '70s and' 80s will make extraordinary films such as _The Girl in the Public Bathroom_, _L'australiano_ and _Moonlighting_ in the 70s and 80s -, but all in all it is worth the vision.</notes>

		<description>Rich heiress Eve Tozer wants to find her father. The attempt is not dictated only by filial love: there is a risk that the father's partner will have him declared his presumed death, thus cutting her off from the inheritance. In the research he gets help from O'Malley, a former ace and aviation hero of the First World War.</description>
		<notes>Great aerial shots and various spectacular sequences. It is the rest of the film, shot in Yugoslavia, which is not there. Tom Selleck tries to exploit the success of the TV series "Magnum P.I.", but with poor results.</notes>

		<description>At an airport in South America, a postal service is being tested. Happy and dramatic events alternate, both for the planes and for the pilots. Among the newcomers, a girl with a difficult character who collides with the captain and a pilot with a not exactly clear past. Between the first two it will end in wedding march; the third will practically save the fate of air service. The film is a bit weak as an environmental reconstruction, but the characters and the story have the typical robustness of Hawks' cinema.</description>

But Allan's brother has disappeared while on the trail of a mythical city of gold, and the archaeologist decides to stay and look for him. Put on the right track by a man who is later murdered, he faces a dangerous journey into the heart of the forest.</description>
		<notes>Second episode of the adventures of Allan Quatermain, with the beautiful Sharon Stone not yet a star at the time. Unfortunately, the screenplay by Gene Quintano does not live up to the adventurous breath of the novel by Haggard, to which the character is inspired.</notes>

The contract signed by the future colonists hides a deception: they are convinced that Jones will get them to the coasts of Virginia, but this is not the case because the captain will take them much further north. The group also includes William, a future settler, and his beautiful wife Dorothy who is very fond of the captain.</description>

Webb accepts only after the death, in an accident, of a child he was fond of. It's serious trouble for Surrett. Weston will restore order to the city and will be able to find a worthy companion for himself.</description>
		<notes>Inspired by the story of Wyatt Earp, the story has a more historical than epic, and yields less than usual to clichés. The direction is rich, accurate and personal; the work on color is interesting, as a function of greater emotional expressiveness.</notes>

		<description>Lee is a forty-year-old cotton industrialist on the verge of bankruptcy, married to Baby Doll, just of age. When the premises of the cotton planters' cooperative go up in flames, suspicions fall on him and Baby Doll plays the game of the man who accuses him. Lee's reaction will be dramatic. From Tennessee William, Kazan signs a film full of ambiguity and eroticism: in the center the figure of the girl with too desirable shapes, which imposes on her the disastrous encounter with the men who surround her. "Baby Doll", like Kubrick's "Lolita", has left indelible traces on the contemporary male collective unconscious.</description>

		<description>Two men are being held in the same cell in a South American prison. The first, Valentin, is a political prisoner punished for plotting against the military regime; the second, Molina, is a homosexual imprisoned for having stalked a boy. The latter consoles himself for the situation by remembering the films he witnessed and inventing new situations starting from these films, which he tells his cellmate.In reality, Molina was put in that cell to steal Valentin's confidence and report it to the military . But the forced cohabitation will lead to unexpected conclusions. Based on a novel by Manuel Puig, it remains perhaps Babenco's best film, all built on the comparison between Julia and Hurt (in an extraordinary interpretation, awarded at Cannes and Oscars) and on the inserts (played by Sonia Braga) of an exotic film invented by Molina. In the original novel, the film was Tourneur's Kiss of the Panther.</description>

To get a sentence discount, he collaborates with the police, exposing the gang he had covered at the time of his arrest.

Amazing debut of Widmark, voiced by Paolo Stoppa. Great Vicotor Mature, who evidently wasn't just the hunk of the blockbusters. Screenplay by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer.</notes>

		<description>Irena Gallier (Kinski) is already grown up, but still a virgin, when she first meets her brother Paul (McDowell). Paul explains that a curse weighs on the two of them: every time they fall in love they turn into panthers. Paul tries anyway with Irena, gets rejected, looks for a prostitute, and of course, turns into a panther. Oliver Yates (Heard), the zoo manager, captures him and puts him in a cage. It is always Yates who offers Irena a job and falls in love with her, with all the risks involved.</description>
		<notes>Schrader manages to win the bet of making a remake of the Tourneur classic, at least partially. Taking advantage of the horror theme of transformation, he highlights the sexual motive and inserts the incestuous variant into it. In the choice of actors he hits the mark with McDowell, as always tormented and perverse, and exploits the angelic aspect of Nastassja Kinski.</notes>

		<description>Young engineer Oliver meets the charming Irene, a girl of Slavic origin at the zoo. In short, the two fall in love and get married. Everything would go well if it were not that Irene refuses to kiss her husband because she fears an ancient curse of her land. According to a legend, in fact, women like her turn into a panther every time they kiss a man.</description>
		<notes>Chilling fable that he interprets and the fears of a historical moment characterized by the spread of Nazi power. One of the masterpieces of producer RKO Val Lewton, built with very few means and with a distressing atmosphere from start to finish. Famous and often cited is the sequence in which the protagonist feels followed by a panther into the swimming pool. "The witches garden", from 1944, is a kind of spin-off. Masterful photography by Nicholas Musuraca.</notes>

		<description>Captivated by the charm of the statue of Venus Anatolia, the window dresser Edie kisses her and witnesses her transformation into a beautiful woman in dismay. It will be just the beginning of a whole series of misunderstandings and adventures.</description>
		<notes>The subject is taken from a famous comedy set to music by Kurt Weill, of which the famous musical motif returns, "Speak low" sung by Eileen Wilson (and in playback by Gardner). Quite funny. Unfortunately, the film is a bit penalized by the lackluster direction of Seiter, a modest craftsman who had directed both Laurel and Hardy and Ginger and Fred. But Gardner is truly satuical.</notes>

		<notes>From the king of hard boiled, Mickey Spillane, the best reduction of one of his short stories. A tense, violent film, with a recomposition of the stereotypical female figure from noir and a screaming protagonist. Ralph Meeker hasn't become a star, but Quentin Tarantino even referred to him as his favorite actor.</notes>

		<description>Lieutenant "Holy Spirit" Donovan is accused of stealing a pile of gold leaving Fort Phoenix; who accuses him is Diego of Habsburg, a bandit interested in gold. The ingots were actually stolen by a fake colonel and a fake sergeant. Spirito Santo eliminates them, recovers the gold, then clashes with Diego and his gang. A beautiful Indian will triumph, even with the help of Suomi's father. The spaghetti-western is now winding down. After Trinity, biblical names are raging, needless to say, and the screenwriters do everything to put a minimum of humor into it; but the gags are worn out and the results to be forgotten.</description>

		<description>Douglas Bader is one of the most skilled pilots of the RAF, the British air force. One day, during an acrobatic demonstration, he dares too much and his plane crashes: Bader is saved, but he loses the use of his legs and is put to rest. At the outbreak of the Second World War, however, the call of the air is stronger and Bader, readmitted into aviation, becomes one of its aces.</description>
		<notes>A typical British war film, the film exalts the courage, self-denial and willpower, which the British soldiers demonstrated on that occasion. Bader's biography is not then pedantic but rather a paradigm of a great moral strength, which sees him win first against himself than against the enemy.</notes>

		<description>An American adventurer lands in India in 1947, shortly after the country's proclamation of independence, with the intention of selling weapons. The situation is confused everywhere and bands of rioters are rampant in various provinces. The American proposes his deal to the prime minister, but the latter refuses. The centers of power and the army are thus left unguarded when the rebels attack. Rather boring and conventional, it does not deviate from the canons of the adventurous-exotic genre very popular at that time in Hollywood. The only exception from the general flatness is the interpretation of Deborah Kerr in the role of the blind daughter of a missionary.</description>

		<description>The protagonist is a quiet man who leads a normal life and works as a lifeguard. His life is fine for him like this, but this is precisely his great fault: he has no ambitions for the future and this a true American cannot afford. Relatives and girlfriend goad him to look for a more profitable profession, for example as a car salesman. Small drama about the problems of ordinary people by the director of Bronx 41st District Police. With a paratelevision setting, the film is not memorable but nevertheless exhibits its sensitivity, a discreet setting and a good work of actors.</description>

		<description>A group of elderly professors and a young philologist are struggling with the drafting of a monumental encyclopedia. When they discover that the spoken language has evolved differently from how they think they decide to "update" and to learn the slang the philologist starts dating an actress. Love is lurking, but comedic results are not lacking as well. Written by Billy Wilder and directed by Hawks, while not an absolute masterpiece, it's hilarious and devilish. Hawks himself will make a color remake of it ("Venus and the Professor") in 1948.</description>

		<description>Lieutenant John Dumbar becomes a war hero in spite of himself; as a prize he receives the Sisko horse and the authorization to choose his next destination. Dumbar asks to be sent to an outpost on the Indian border, in Sioux territory. A period begins for him that will profoundly change him and make him reborn as a new man in the tribe of Kicking Bird and Wind in Hair.</description>
		<notes>The film was one of the most extraordinary cinematic events of recent years. To make it happen, Kevin Costner had to overcome a thousand obstacles: no one wanted to finance his western mostly spoken in the Sioux language. Against all odds the project was realized, the film achieved extraordinary success and got seven Oscars. Cold, a western not as revolutionary as has been said and written (review the classics, please), but certainly a remarkable show . Kevin Reynolds ("Fandango") directed uncredited.</notes>

		<description>London, 1954. Ruth works in a nightclub, is divorced and the mother of a child. Desmond, a shy middle-aged man is in love with her, and would like to marry her, but Ruth is overwhelmed by a passion for David, a car racer. Theirs is a tumultuous bond and the situation worsens when David, who has since been drinking, is reprimanded in his environment because Ruth does not belong to his world. It will end in tragedy. The film tells the true story of the last woman sentenced to death in Great Britain, whose execution sparked a harsh campaign in public opinion, which would have led to the abolition of the death penalty. Newell sensitively stages an image of 1950s England gray, dirty, desperate. In this universe, completely closed in on itself, a passion develops between two beings, which everything seems to separate, destined to clash with the hypocrisy of common morality. Because of her social position, Ruth is defeated from the start; her desperate gesture is a cry of protest, to which the system responds by condemning her definitively.</description>

It is thought to kidnap Vespa, daughter of Roland, and to ask for the air as a ransom. Vespa escapes in his spaceship shortly before marrying a half-fool prince. An adventurer living in a space camper tracks her down and brings her home. Parody of the "Star Wars" saga, it distorts situations and characters, but Mel Brooks has done better.</description>

		<description>Pricò is a child left by his mother, who ran away from home with a lover, and tossed from one environment to another by his father, a modest bank employee. Back home, the mother lets herself be drawn back into the old troubled relationship. The husband, not enduring yet another escape, commits suicide. Thus Pricò finds himself having to face a desperate situation, which reveals his little-great soul.</description>
		<notes>Heartbreaking mélo by Vittorio De Sica. If the context and the murky sentimental intrigues seem feuilleton, the psychology of the child is instead defined with an exceptional sensitivity. Splendid screenplay by Cesare Zavattini.</notes>

		<description>The "perfect" child, a kind of magical bearer of peace and harmony that according to an oriental sect sees the light every thousand generations, is kidnapped by the forces of evil. According to an ancient oracle, only Chandler Jarrell, a Californian expert in missing children, can find him. Among a thousand adventures, the searches lead Jarrell, led by a beautiful adept, to Tibet.</description>
		<notes>Despite the poor quality of the film, this fantastic comedy was a smash hit in the United States. Not so elsewhere. However Eddie Murphy is definitely subdued by his standards.</notes>

A slightly clumsy yuppie accompanies her on her dangerous mission through the desert areas of the southwestern United States. Charming, energetic and casual, after the success of A career woman, Griffith demonstrates versatility and wit in the somewhat parodic game of this feminine Mad Max. In the cast, the old "tough" Dana Andrews, and two icons of John Ford: Harry Carey jr. and Ben Johnson</description>

Giulio feels so attracted to her that he introduces himself to his parents, asking to be able to see her. Accustomed to quick conquests, the man realizes that Ivana is instead a very demanding type ...</description>
		<notes>A decidedly underrated film, both at the time of its release and in the following years. Giraldi is a discreet director, capable of psychological refinements that leave their mark. Not a masterpiece, but a work that affects. And Tognazzi, as usual, is not discussed.</notes>

		<description>Banana Joe is the owner of an established banana business in the country of Amantido, located in an unspecified location in Latin America. Everything would go smoothly if a bad day did not appear, a boss of the underworld. The shady figure would like to set up an industry in Amantido and eliminate Banana Joe from the market. To do this he attacks him on the bureaucratic front: Joe, in fact, who does not have a commercial license, cannot continue his work. It goes without saying that in a banana republic the law of the strongest ultimately prevails.</description>

		<description>A man who has just been abandoned by his wife meets by chance a runaway boy and a girl who is intolerant of her job. The three come into possession of a wallet and get an old car with which they start a journey through the streets of New Zealand but, almost immediately, they are searched for by the police. A sort of manhunt begins and the three show great inventiveness in escaping the traps set by the police. It's the classic American imitation road-movie, centered on a group of likeable and inventive outcasts who have to cope with everything and everyone. Some gimmicks are fun and the characters' characters are drawn with originality. One of the few New Zealand films that has been distributed around the world.</description>

		<description>Amantha Starr, daughter of a wealthy Kentucky planter, is not entitled to her father's inheritance because her mother was a black slave; it is then sold on the public market. Hamish Bond buys her, a rich and enigmatic gentleman who falls in love with her, reciprocated, to the point of making her the queen of his possessions.</description>
		<notes>After "Gone with the Wind", Clark Gable is again the protagonist of a drama, complex and complicated, set during the conflict between Northerners and Southerners. But this film certainly does not hold up the comparison with the famous precedent; many twists, but pure professional direction and little more than discreet acting.</notes>

Crime is definitely not the bread for the teeth of Bonocore and his companions ...</description>
		<notes>Again the great Totò in the company of the faithful Peppino, in a film that has become a classic of Italian comedy. The screenplay is by Age and Scarpelli and the dialogues are perky. The memorable moment is the sequence of the first ticket being sold.</notes>

Then one day their luck turns, their car is recognized by a policeman and a shooting is unleashed from which only Legenz comes out unscathed. But it soon ends up under a train.

When the man meets the beautiful Gaby (Balin), he hopes to be able to follow her to France and rebuild a life. But he is captured and, at the departure of the ship on which the woman is embarked, Pépé commits suicide. A great mixture of "mélo" and "noir" which earned Jean Gabin the definitive consecration. Some sequences (the pianola, the whole finale at the port) have entered the history of cinema.</description>

Here he organizes a big theft, quarrels with his accomplices, takes a bit of a beating and ends up in hospital. Nurse Martha falls in love with him and together they go to New Rochelle where he studies to carry out another theft, has another accident and marriage. He goes to New York with new robbery intentions, has a love affair, and is reported by his wife. But his daring events are not over yet. Valuable reconstruction of a period and a certain narrative fluency, for a story that refers to the biography of Gerald Graham Dennis, thief and heartthrob.

		<description>After getting rich during Prohibition, a gangster wants to leave the underworld. He engages in the beer trade; of the gang he keeps with him only three loyal ones as driver, waiter and cook; Meanwhile, his daughter is engaged to an excellent young federal agent. But for a successful integration into the business world and guaranteeing a profitable honesty, there will be a need for a last illegal gimmick: a genial gangster-comedy, which starting from a subject at first sight dramatic manages to radically transform it. The parody, however, is not an end in itself and is colored with bizarre realism: a different point of view on prohibition.</description>

The gang, with a woman as a hostage, takes refuge in Mexico, in the region where ferocious bandoleros rage. Pursued by the sheriff, they arrive at the showdown.</description>
		<notes>The cast is bubbly, but directing is pure craft. Andrew McLaglen (Four of the Wild Goose) doesn't go beyond entertainment. Concessions to sentiment are routine and somewhat hasty.</notes>

		<description>The film tells the totally invented story of the bandit Barabbas, who was fortunately freed at the expense of that Jesus of Nazareth who ended up innocent on the cross. After committing other crimes, Barabbas is sentenced to forced labor in a mine. He later becomes a gladiator and meets another slave who has become a Christian. He will die on the cross, like that never forgotten Jesus.</description>
		<notes>From the novel by Par Lagerkvist. There is a certain lack of dramatic tension in the film, but the spectacular effectiveness is first-rate; excellent photography by Aldo Tonti. Good times, when Italian cinema could still afford colossal productions!</notes>

		<description>Anne is the eighth wife of Baron Klaus von Sepper, a heroic WWI aviator who later became a Nazi. The soldier, due to a war wound, has a curious blue beard. Wandering around the manor of her spouse, the woman discovers a cold room with the corpses of the brides who preceded her.</description>
		<notes>The film uses the screenplay by Ennio De Concini and Maria Pia Fusco, music by Ennio Morricone and photography by Gábor Pogány. The result, unfortunately, is not the best. Dmytryk with the help of Luciano Sacripanti conducts a tired variation on Perrault's fairy tale.</notes>

		<description>England, late 1600s. Yellowbeard, former pirate of the Jamaica Sea, manages to escape from the prisons of His British Majesty. The corsair wants to recover a treasure whose map, before being destroyed, was tattooed on the skull of his child. Except that the son is now a bold twenty and, in the treasure, many are interested.</description>
		<notes>It is a comic reinterpretation - with Monty Python among the performers - of the adventurous trend of piracy. The whole is quite ramshackle, despite the merits of the historical reconstruction and some spectacular solutions. The dubbing is not very accurate either.</notes>

To achieve his goal, Kadar has the twins Gore and Kutchek kidnapped and destined for grueling jobs. The twins, however, flee and after a thousand vicissitudes, having come into possession of the ruby, they defeat Kadar, restoring happiness to their people. The long wave of Conan's various grandchildren couldn't fail to hit Italian cinema. This film aligns in the vein which, between a bodybuilding exhibition and the other, weaves its fantastic story.</description>

But the Germans are organizing a last defense based on biological warfare right here. Suspected of being saboteurs, the two "heroes" unwittingly eliminate the German colonel and blow up the science laboratory. But that's not all: many more troubles await them.</description>

Stopped by a breakdown, they wait a long time for the Marquis's check to pay for the damage.</description>
		<notes>Unusual and captivating the interpretation of Jean Gabin, perfectly at ease, but equally brilliant is that of Micheline Presle in the role of his unfaithful partner. Based on a Simenon novel and directed by Delannoy, the film focuses heavily on sparkling dialogues (written by Michel Audiard) and the skill of a hilarious Gabin.</notes>

		<description>Baron Carlo Mazza (Taranto) squandered all the substances left him by his ancestors. To remedy the situation he accepts a marriage of interest with a beautiful girl who, however, turns out to be rather free of morals and makes him ridiculous among friends. The marriage, which took place with a strange ritual, is not valid and the girl can go to America to enjoy her riches. The baron will have to find other ways to get by. Taranto re-proposes on the screen one of its most famous and hilarious specks, on a non-existent script.</description>

		<description>In 1700, at the Russian court, the baron meets Cagliostro who assures him of eternal youth and gives him a ring that makes him invisible. After seducing the Tsarina, he faces incredible adventures in the war against the Turks. Later, he manages to escape the Venetian police aboard a hot-air balloon and takes refuge on the moon ... Back on Earth he converts to a normal life, gets married, gives up eternal youth: we are now in the twentieth century. Here he is, in 1943, who tells his life to his friends. Spectacular, financed with huge means by the Nazi regime for the 25th anniversary of the production company UFA, it is a pleasant mine of vintage rarities in the field of special effects.</description>

		<notes>From a novel by Thackeray, yet another masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick, a bitter reflection on history and power. The work on light and color is memorable, obtained using natural lighting in some cases also by "candlelight".

Jealous, Silver's ex-flame has her kicked out of the company. Only after many adventures the two will reunite.</description>
		<notes>It is a modest comedy, between the satirical and the grotesque, which targets the provincial entertainment environment. The director Salce certainly does not find his best vein here, probably exhausted at the end of the sixties, after having given us (often paired with Tognazzi) films including "Il federal" and "La wish matta".</notes>

However, the Vietnamese also want to capture him: this opens up a great manhunt, in which Hambleton can count on the self-denial and cunning (he communicates with his team using the language of golf) of an expert pilot ...</description>
		<notes>Based on a fact that really happened, the film takes the Vietnam War as a pure pretext to analyze Hambleton's behavior and moods, reaching the point of singing the praises of solidarity.</notes>

Between laughing gas, death and "artistic" devastation, Joker shocks the city with cruel clowning. The two masked men have already met and clashed in the past: Joker is the one who killed Bruce's parents as a child, Batman is the indirect cause of the criminal's disfigured face.</description>

		<description>In 1850 the Oregon territory was still firmly controlled by the Indians. The outpost of the whites is Fort River, commanded by the tough officer Archer. The Indians are on a war footing, incited by a white trafficker, Stacey Wyatt. Discovering Stacey's plans, he captures him, takes him to the Indian camp, makes him confess everything and establishes a lasting peace with the Indians. The plot is similar to that of many other westerns, but you can feel the hand of Castle, one of the wizards of the American B series.</description>

		<description>In a small Australian town, a group of men hunt down a man suspected of murder. Action film lacking dynamism, however. Second work by a director with years of militancy in TV productions, including some episodes of the serial Dinasty. The performers, coming from heterogeneous experiences of cinema, theater and TV, are practically left to themselves. The film certainly does not enjoy the good season of Australian cinema that flourished between the seventies and eighties with works such as Picnic at Hanging Rock or the Mad Max cycle.</description>

Professor Belding, who is around with other people, is convinced to become a customer of the hotel to revive its fortunes. Then Kelly discovers that the handsome lawyer, called by his grandfather and whose charm he can't resist, agrees with the enemy. Teenage film designed for a distracted summer vision, engages despite the weak central vein. The sunny, canonical and glossy stage of the Hawaiian tourist "paradises" is the background.</description>

A dancer, who has broken the rules, forces him to nurse his baby, convincing him that the baby is the illegitimate son of Filippo, nephew and assistant of the impresario himself. Then the newborns in the arms of the impresario become two: and this time it is precisely a son of Filippo.</description>

		<description>We are in New York in the 1950s and Duffy feels time slipping through her fingers. Duffy is a cartoonist, but the thing that worries him most is the desire for fatherhood. He tries with Meg, a girl he met at a party. The two get married, but the marriage doesn't last long. Then comes Daphne, a young girl, young, but definitely more "smart" in this kind of thing.</description>
		<notes>The cue should be funny and Gene Wilder, on average, is a convincing comedian. The fact that all this does not work depends mainly on the director Leonard Nimoy (Dr. Spock of "Star Trek") who tries to repeat the hit of "Three Bachelors and a Baby", but without succeeding.</notes>

		<description>The handsome Antonio Mangano (Mastroianni) returns to Catania from Rome, preceded by fame as a Don Juan, to marry the splendid and apparently naive Barbara (Cardinal). After a while it turns out that he is impotent and she is therefore still a virgin. Barbara's relatives then see the opportunity for a good deal.</description>
		<notes>From Brancati's ferocious novel, a merciless and bitter portrait of Fascism and Gallism, Bolognini directs a film that is more crepuscular than biting, also because it moves the events to the 1950s and some interpreter is wrong (the very French Brasseur who plays Antonio's father). But the melancholy Catania photographed by Nannuzzi and the languid photogenicity of the protagonists still give it a certain atmosphere. Screenplay by Gino Visentioni and Pier Paolo Pasolini.</notes>

		<description>Helen organizes with her brother-in-law-lover David the kidnapping of her husband Ben, owner of a fashion house in Los Angeles. The FBI investigates the kidnapping, in particular agent Dillon. According to the threat, the kidnappers send his wife, as the first ... installment of the spouse, one of her fingers; but they are located and, on their escape, they end up in a ravine. The "case", however, is far from resolved. The story, with its continuous twists and turns, is so forced that the assumption of its reliability falls away. That said, the narrative mechanism is held on a fairly average level, without originality but also without drops in tone.</description>

Today, having become a rich heiress, she has decided to repay her debt by sending each inhabitant of the town an envelope containing one thousand dollars. But such sudden wealth generates more inconvenience than good ...</description>

But one day a painter arrives in the village and follows her on her ascent to the mountain. Riefenstahl's mountain film, which soon after will be the official director of the Fuhrer. And even in this film, despite the film theorist Bela Balasz (communist) among the screenwriters, there is an air of "blood and soil".</description>

		<description>When Carolina Otero began performing as a dancer in the small Andalusian village where she was born, no one could imagine that she would quickly become the most sought-after artist of the Paris theaters. Many men went crazy for her and tried to win her heart, but the only love of her life was the impossible one with a helpless businessman. After the successes came the bitter days of decadence, which Otero will still be able to live with great dignity. Scripted in episodes of Spanish origin, with many Italian actors and above all with Harvey Keitel, the appreciated protagonist of Piano Lessons, it also has a longer television version.</description>

		<description>Michele Fiore is a skilled swindler of rich widows: he ensnares them with captivating advertisements in the newspapers, he knows them, he robs them. Trouble begins when he discovers that one of the widowers is a werewolf, while another is suffering from a conspicuous physical defect. But the final blow will be suffered by Paola, one of his victims, who, while he is in prison, changes sex.</description>
		<notes>Carlo Giuffré is, after all, a glory of the Neapolitan theater. Then to make a living you do everything, even films with Nando Cicero. Giuffré puts his craft and irony into it, Marisa Mell and Erika Blanc their graces. The director, on the other hand, takes nothing.</notes>

		<description>Eddie is an opera manager with a penchant for women. Being married doesn't hold him back that much. Nor does the suicide of Lucy, a young opera singer with whom he had previously had an affair, particularly disturbs him. The situation worsens, however, when the corpses of his ex-lovers multiply. Riccardo Sesani had already distinguished himself in Good as the bread, played by Carmen Russo. In this ugly copy of Dario Argento's Opera, he instead uses Adriana Russo, an ex-plus from Drive-In, thus demonstrating that she has a certain sense of size and little imagination in surnames.</description>

		<notes>Life in London under Thatcher as told by Mike Leigh awarded as Best Director at the Cannes Film Festival.

The yellow-pink climate is suitable for a light story but conducted with the typical rhythm dictated by the trade. With Mamie Van Doren, the "Marylin of the poor", a certain modest eroticism is also assured.</notes>

		<description>Nino is seventeen years old and has some sexual disturbances towards his aunt Cettina (Gina Lollobrigida). She has a husband, no children and some maternal instinct towards her grandson. The relationship is short: Cettina then gives herself to Sasà, her husband's partner. Nino makes a drama out of it, but then he recovers and marries his cousin Giulietta. Which does not mean that the affair with the aunt is over ...</description>
		<notes>Based on a novel by Ercole Patti, the film struggles especially from a rhythmic point of view. For once, Lollo does not appear at her best, perhaps carried away by the opacity of the whole cast.</notes>

		<description>Franco and Ciccio are two thugs who get by with small tricks. One day a southern sergeant confides to them, on his deathbed, the place where a treasure is buried. The two, however, each know only half of the indications for the precious recovery. On the trail of gold there is also another character: the "Beautiful". The three buddies, however, are mocked by the fascinating Fabienne.</description>
		<notes>Yet another parody made by the two comedians, this time struggling with the rereading of "The good, the bad and the ugly" by Sergio Leone. All in all funny, starting with the title.</notes>

		<description>The Bridges family, consisting of dad, mom, three boys and a girl, lives on a lonely farm in the mountains of California. The old head of the family, dazed by alcohol, does not take care of the farm, so much so that his wife has given the command to Curt the eldest. When a ferocious and elusive puma begins to massacre men and cattle, the tight hunt for the beast begins.</description>
		<notes>Psychodrama with an adventurous background that today would be considered ecologically "incorrect". Wellman conducts with his usual grit. The unusual color-black and white mix of William H. Clothier's photography is masterful.</notes>

		<notes>The film is certainly one of the greatest cinematographic productions ever made: costing about twenty million dollars, it won eleven Oscars. Film with an epic structure, it retains all the peculiar characteristics of the genre: grandiloquent staging, large number of actors, pomp of costumes. The chariot race was reprized in "Star Wars - The Phantom Menace". The novel by General Lee Wallace from which it is based had already been adapted by Fred Niblo in 1926.</notes>

In short, he is a good bourgeois with many ambitions and little imagination. Then, suddenly, his life changes completely: he falls in love with Vickie, a girl who works in an ice cream shop, leaves his wife and also every political project. William A. Graham, one of the most prolific directors of American television, bases this television film on a real episode. The actors are not stars, although some may remember Susan Dey in the role of strip messenger in Echo Park. not to be confused with the film of the same name directed by Wes Craven.</description>

		<notes>The newcomer (in the feature film) Jonathan Heap has a not bad subject in his hand, but he wastes it by pandering to the unlikely aspects of the story. However, the tension is there, and the use of the environmental framework is effective. Donald Sutherland with such an ambiguous and unpleasant character goes to a wedding.</notes>

		<description>Lucy is married to a surgeon, but damages her professional aspirations with childlike simplicity. On the other hand, she is very attached to her sister Zelda who practices a kind of picturesque magic. But it happens that Lucy dies, because of a (Korean) meatball that goes sideways. A year later, Zelda resurrects her ... It is well known that the theme of reincarnation has a hold on the most gullible sections of Americans. The purpose of Frank Perry's film would be to make fun of these beliefs, but it does so in such a banal and puppet-like way that it slips into easy farce without being able to set the tone of costume criticism.</description>

		<description>Intrigued by reading a novel that tells of a passionate and crazy love story of a pianist from Ghent for a Neapolitan magistrate, the screenwriter François goes to Belgium to interview the author. The woman at first reluctant, gradually lets herself go, and describes the story as if she were reliving her personal memories: but what is the boundary between reality and imagination? Pretentious and hermetic, the film, however, is conducted with a certain rigor and with a very prominent cast.</description>

		<description>In 1978, Helmut Palmer escaped from East Germany by hijacking a Polish airliner. The American judge Stern is called to the NATO base in Berlin to try him and Sigrid, also a refugee with her daughter Marina, and accused of complicity in the hijacking. Against political-diplomatic pressures, Stern ascertains the woman's innocence and gets a fair and regular trial for Palmer.</description>
		<notes>The film mechanism cleverly echoes some classics of the genre, such as "Winners and losers", and is made exciting by the figure of the magistrate voted to justice against all handling and ambiguity, well designed by Sheen.</notes>

		<description>A splendid lady appears repeatedly to Bernadette Soubirous, daughter of a poor family from Lourdes, while grazing sheep in the open countryside. The fact is on everyone's lips. The authorities accuse Bernadette of inventing everything, but ordinary people, poor people who have faith, believe her. One day a miraculous spring arises at the place of the visions. The fame of the girl and the fountain goes beyond the narrow confines of the village. Bernadette retires to the convent, where she will die after having endured the sufferings of a serious illness with great serenity.</description>
		<notes>Without awe, Hollywood approaches the mysteries of Lourdes, transforming them into a very successful international popular show. After three years of advertising preparation, it is the film that Jennifer Jones launches, immediately consecrating her as a star. Oscar to Jennifer Jones and to soundtrack, photography and scenography.</notes>

First film by Peter Bogdanovich and one of the last for Elder Boris Karloff. Melancholic cinephile parable on the horrors of celluloid and real America (in the years of Vietnam).</description>

		<description>Alex is a black Detroit cop, far too good, far too diligent. This is why his bosses do not like him dealing with some murders that took place in Beverly Hills and they take him off the job. But Alex doesn't give up: he takes vacation and goes to California to investigate on his own. As he learns more and more interesting things about illegal securities and drug trafficking, the local police put a spoke in his wheel. Alex does not let himself be discouraged by anything: neither by the threats he receives from evil nor by those of his colleagues.</description>
		<notes>Director Martin Brest has the merit of betting everything on the personality of Eddie Murphy, who dominates the film from top to bottom. In the story there is a lot of dynamism, shootings and spectacular car chases.</notes>

		<description>Michele teaches in a bizarre private school. He spends his free time in the obsessive observation and filing of the private and sentimental life of friends and neighbors. A neighbor is found killed; the police investigate. Michele meets a new colleague, Bianca, with whom he has a relationship. A couple of friends closes their crisis in an anomalous way. The two are found dead in turn ...</description>
		<notes>One of the best films by Nanni Moretti. His traditional alter ego, Michele, is charged with ambiguity and malaise: fetishisms, phobias compress his existence and upset his balance. Morality and scandal have limited margins of coexistence.</notes>

		<description>Two former comrades who have set up a variety company, are hired for the Christmas party at the "Snow Paradise", a mountain hotel that is deserted because there is no ... snow. The hotel belongs to their old general who is now on the verge of bankruptcy. In the name of the ancient camaraderie, the two put themselves together and the party is a triumph. In addition, there is also snow and ... love.</description>

		<description>On the occasion of the political elections, some personalities residing for work in other cities and abroad, return to Rome. There is the pedantically obsessive family man who makes his wife run away with another; the burinotto emigrated to Germany who dreams of finally enjoying Italian cuisine and a naive big boy who has to accompany his grandmother, but covers her with such suffocating attentions as to make her ... die of rage.</description>
		<notes>After the sensational success of "A lot beautiful", Verdone tries again with this film. A little repetitive, but the characters are spot on.</notes>

		<description>Josh Baskin a thirteen year old boy, playing with a coin-operated machine in the amusement park, which reproduces the effigy of the magician Zoltar, expresses the desire to become great. Indeed, the next day he wakes up with the features of a 25 year old. For the rest, however, he remained the boy from before.</description>
		<notes>The film is a comedy bordering on the fantastic; entertains in an intelligent way, tries to make us reflect on the universe of children. Between dream and reality, an uplifting little story unfolds that in the midst of toys and good feelings unites young and old for once. Inspired by the movie "As an adult" with Pozzetto, or is the similarity coincidental?</notes>

		<description>Everyone in New Orleans is corrupt. Homicide's Remy McSwain (Dennis Quaid) isn't exactly a sitter. When Anne Osborne (Ellen Barkin), assistant district attorney, comes to investigate, relations between the two are not the most peaceful. They only get better when a story of homicides and heroin trafficking comes up in which some top police officers are involved. Remy and Anne, finally in love and in agreement, solve the case. History is very predictable. But the direction of Jim McBride, (Until the last breath), is shrewd and wise. Not to mention that the Quaid-Barkin duo, from start to finish, sparkles.</description>

But when Mr. Henderson decides to bring him back to his environment, Bigfoot escapes. A grim gamekeeper immediately sets out on his trail.</description>
		<notes>Film obviously intended for families with children; slightly ramshackle fairytale with obvious Spielberg and (the step is short) Disney references, with vague ecological allusions, but above all full of those clichés that give safety. Sympathetic and bungler, Bigfoot can only arouse tenderness and emotion.</notes>

Eventually, as strangers they were, they will find great friends.</description>

		<description>At the outbreak of the Second World War, a young provincial is looking forward to making his contribution to the nation. This is why he is the first in his country to enlist, convinced that, by doing so, he will get straight to the front line. However, he never manages to enter battle because he is destined ... for training recruits.</description>
		<notes>The idea is not evil but the attempted satire of militarism goes a little off target and the comedy is quite linear and, consequently, quite funny. We have fun with the comical misunderstandings of who must become a hero at all costs.</notes>

		<description>In 1797, the sailor Billy Budd is embarked on the Indomita, where all are friends with him except one member of the crew, Claggart who has it to death with him and reports him to the captain as a subversive element. Billy kills Claggart and the court martial sentences him to hang, despite the crew being entirely on his side. Then, in the moment of danger, the honor of the country is placed before the passions. The direction of Ustinov does not give much strength to the story, but the psychological investigation of the characters and the acting of the actors, including the director himself, are remarkable.</description>

		<description>Charlie Parker, the greatest sax in jazz history, carries the nickname "Bird" from childhood, when he didn't have the money to get into the club and heard music from the backyard. For this it was "yardbird", or courtyard bird. Charlie later bought a saxophone and quickly became famous. His music made us dream but his private life was a disaster: drugs, alcohol, sex, despair. At thirty-four he began playing only for the Great Reaper.</description>

		<description>Fresh from Vietnam, Birdy is totally annihilated, turned in on himself. In the good old days, he was fond of bird flying; now, in the hospital, the proximity of an old friend, also wounded in the war, gives him support. With his help, the past resurfaces and a dream never realized: to fly. Parker throws himself on the stereotypes of the military-psychological drama already exploited by Hollywood on a thousand occasions. She does it in her usual style: heavy, exhibitionist, heedless of the involuntary ridicule to which excess emphasis can sometimes lead. The technical feats (flight sequence) do not raise the level of the whole much.</description>

		<description>Elia (Celentano) lives in his splendid isolation near Voghera. He does not love the city, he does not like company and he is bothered by the women he sees as perturbers of rural peace. Only the housekeeper Mamy is allowed on the farm. But one day the beautiful Lisa (Muti) breaks the car right there and falls in love with the misanthrope; first for a bet, then for passion, she decides to seduce him. It won't be an easy feat and Lisa will succeed when she least expects it. Perhaps the greatest success of the Celentano-Muti duo. Although Celentano is comfortable in the role, the film is ramshackle, moralistic, crafty and superficial.</description>

		<description>A successful doctor has a rather unhappy and troubled family life, which is leading to a divorce. As if the couple's troubles were not enough, they also bring about those of work, when he is involved in a trial for professional negligence; trial that ends up causing a murder. Normally stories like this are played quickly with few chances, leaving the field open to boredom. Here a good screenplay avertes the danger with dignity.</description>

		<description>In 1931, shortly after the death of Leon Bix Beiderbecke, considered the best white-skinned jazz player in history, his brother Burnie is commissioned by his mother to track down his betrothed, Lisa. Burnie gradually discovers the truth: Bix hasn't been able to play for a long time because he was made ugly by alcohol, and he had no one next to him to comfort him. Lisa herself was a stranger: Bix had limited himself to buying a picture of her in a photo shop and mailing it to her mother. Always passionate about jazz, Avati is very precise on the musical side of the story; but the melodramatic aspect is instead rhetorical and tearful.</description>

		<description>Van lives with his father and his lover, since his mother has been missing for several years. The grandmother stays in a hospice, where Van goes to visit her often. He manages to make her escape with the help of Aline, a call girl whose mother died in the same hospice, and to take her to a more decent retirement home, where she finds her mother. Atom Egoyan's film intrigues for the ambiguity of the narrative tones: the apparent happy ending actually feeds on too many "dark" elements to be truly believable, while what remains is rather his feverish obsession with the presence of video image in daily reports.</description>

		<description>Nick, an unorthodox policeman, witnesses a multiple murder in a restaurant and manages to capture the killer, a Japanese man who must be returned to the authorities of his country. Here Nick and his colleague and best friend, Charlie, are mocked by the accomplices of the killer who "blow" the prisoner. Nick and Charlie find themselves embroiled in a bloody gang war.</description>
		<notes>Ridley Scott immerses the whole Japanese part of the adventure in an atmosphere curiously similar to that of "Blade Runner". The result is a thrilling and unusual detective story, violent and alienated. Like his two detectives catapulted from the United States into modern Japan.</notes>

		<description>The only survivors of a shipwreck, a child, Alec, and a black stallion, take refuge on an African island. Here the horse saves the boy's life again by crushing a snake. Collected from a ship, the two return to America, where an elderly coach takes care of the boy and the animal, making one grow and ask the other: together they will win an important race. The first work of the documentarian Carrol Ballard, the film was appreciated for the unusual grace with which the theme of friendship between children and animals was treated. Exciting and moving without being mushy, the film skillfully combines adventure and friendship.</description>

		<description>Dahlia is the head of a Palestinian terrorist organization that plans to kill 80,000 people and the President of the United States during a football game. Federal agent Corley and Israeli major Kabakov follow him. The two follow a faint trail at first to Beirut, but to no avail; then in the USA, when the countdown to the massacre began.</description>
		<notes>Based on the first novel by Thomas Harris (that of "The Silence of the Lambs"), an excellent thriller directed with particular inspiration by Frankenheimer. More violent and more beautiful than the average of the action of the time.</notes>

		<description>We are in Los Angeles, swarming and immense, in the near future: a former police detective, specializing in the hunting and "withdrawal" of rebel replicants, is called back into service to find four, escaped from an extraterrestrial colony. After the mission his life is completely changed. After the success he had with the first "Alien", Ridley Scott returns to science fiction, however, mixing it with the noir atmospheres of the forties detective stories. The result is fascinating: for the labyrinthine, suffocating sets, for the rough melancholy of the story, for the superb presence of Harrison Ford. This version of the film is the one desired by the director without the cuts imposed by the production.</description>

The criminals arrive to kill a friend and even his beloved daughter. Tiger's revenge will be tremendous. Italian film for the international market. Lamberto Bava jr, under the pseudonym of John Old, draws on different sources for this Blastfighter, from the western to the first Rambo by Ted Kotcheff: a clear division between the Good and the Bad combined with the inexorable spectacularity of the primary reactions and that's it.</description>

But it turns out that the fields are depleted and, moreover, the Russians are also interested in the operation. By a series of lucky coincidences, it turns out that 300 kilos of this "notorious" mineral sank along with the Titanic. And so the frantic and frantic searches begin, on the verge of armed conflict ...</description>

		<description>A gelatinous, unknown and voracious substance appears in the streets of an American town and unceremoniously swallows those who have the misfortune to come within range. Extraterrestrial stuff? Not even for an idea: it is the product of a military experiment, aimed at creating a powerful bacteriological weapon, escaped the control of scientists. Luckily, Brian, a rebellious but smart boy, takes care of it. From a famous 1958 B movie, he is betting all his chances on the progress made in the last thirty years in the field of special effects. Easy game, from this point of view, but otherwise the film does not go beyond the purely spectacular aspect.</description>

He discovers all this in Los Angeles where the bloodsuckers will take their revenge on the Hunters.</description>
		<notes>Among the many variations on the vampire theme, this youthful-sociological turn could not be missing, with allusions to generational and racial themes. Good tension and care for the image, for a director who had already made the remake of "Until the last breath".</notes>

		<notes>All right, the movie is bad. But it has a certain, so to speak, "philological" value. It is among the titles of a series of films produced by Lucio Fulci, and has also been distributed under the title of "The Snake's Nest" and abroad as "The Snake House". Fulci used some images from the film in "A cat in the brain", for example the scene in which Rozzani's rotten corpse in a wheelchair swoops over Wagner, crushing a doll. For enthusiasts, all others abstain.</notes>

Elwood (Dan Aykroyd), his brother, explains that if they don't find $ 50,000 to pay in taxes within a few days, the Chicago orphanage they grew up in will be forced to close. At the rhythm'n'blues mass of the Reverend James Brown, a window opens up for Jake: to reconstitute the old "Blues Brothers Band", organize a concert and pay back taxes with the proceeds. Easier said than done, of course ...</description>
		<notes>We are certain that there is no other film like this one: because it has the most beautiful soundtrack in the history of cinema, because the grace that the Reverend James Brown invokes on the faithful seems to have rained down on all the names that parade in the credits, because an alchemy like that between Aykroyd and Belushi cannot be repeated. But above all for the total anarchy, fiercely joyful, that inhabits it: to hell with the Nazis, the cops, the women (a wonderful trio of seduced and abandoned). In the unpunished and glorious collapse of 103 cars, the mockery of the blockbuster cinema resounds, which in the following decade would have definitively engulfed the screens: Spielberg, a tax employee, will also cash the check, but does not participate in the party.</notes>

		<notes>Against the backdrop of a musical event in Naples in the mid-1980s, a series of events based on sex, drugs and rock are intertwined.

During a normal opening night, the two want to get hold of the money contained in the safe. When the operation is about to go through, he gets attracted to the gaming table and wastes precious time. He manages to win a large sum, but the blow fails: he will be arrested, while the accomplice is shot down by the police. No one like Jean-Pierre Melville has managed to make the French underworld centered around romantic criminals and carrion cops. This lesser-known film, his first noir, already melancholy and fragmented, also goes along the same lines.</description>

		<description>A scholar is killed when he is about to provide evidence against the dangers of drugs manufactured by a powerful industry. The widow hunts for the tycoon to which the company belongs, with the help of a former CIA agent now retired, Jerry Fanon. An undertaking that gradually turns out to be more and more absurd, both because of the difficulties with which it is scattered, and because in reality the woman with the passage of time turns out to be more and more attached to money than to the cause of justice.</description>
		<notes>Michael Winner's name is usually related to the detective genre, particularly to that of Charles Bronson in the Night Enforcer series. Here we are between adventure and international espionage: risky terrain for this not particularly refined director. The cast, however, is very respectable.</notes>

		<description>Renzo is a worker and Luciana is employed. They love each other, they get married, they move in together, but they work different shifts and therefore they never see each other. The subject is by Zavattini and the screenplay, among others, by Calvino; but the film deserves neither.</description>

		<description>Faithfully inspired by the famous work of Puccini, taken from the book by Henri Murger "Scenes from the life of bohème", the film traces the stories of friends Marcello, a painter, and Rodolfo, a poet, who live in an attic in Paris. In the attic next door lives Mimì, with whom Rodolfo falls in love while Marcello has a troubled affair with Musetta. Poverty, however, is stronger than feelings and, moreover, Mimi is sick with tuberculosis, the evil of the century that does not forgive ...</description>

Butterfield is married under a false name in North Creeck, where he works esteemed by the townspeople and the sheriff. Everyone knows his story and they know he is innocent. And even tough Bovard will understand this. Flawless little western by the old Curtiz, here almost at the end of his career (like the protagonist Taylor).</description>

		<description>Texas, 1933. Bonnie Parker, a waitress in a bar, meets Clyde Barrow, falls in love with him and starts robbing banks. In a short time the two become famous: the police are unable to capture them, while among the dispossessed reduced to poverty by the 1929 crisis they become two heroes, the symbol of a revolt that everyone dreams of carrying out. But times become increasingly difficult: the police multiply the traps and manage to convince the father of an accomplice to report their hiding place. They will end up riddled with the shots of the cops. In contested America of the 1960s, the two anarchist robbers achieved great, unexpected success. Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (Estelle Parsons) and for photography.</description>

To save himself from debts and raise the shack, he accepts the offer of a creditor, who has lost an eye and asks for his in return.</description>

For a misunderstanding he is mistaken, by a colleague, for a lived playboy, but the dream doesn't last long.</description>
		<notes>Verdone tries to get out of the macchiettismo of his characters. Here he tells a story where dreams and reality merge and in which his character tries to emerge from the greyness of a flat and bourgeois life. Soundtrack by Lucio Dalla.</notes>

Clark thus finds himself engaged as well as involved in the Sabatini trade: an embarrassing situation, from which, however, he will be able to draw his advantages ...</description>

The life of the two couples is marked by war events and only one of the two couples will be able to emigrate to Canada. Here too there are problems to overcome, but finally the family settles down. And the children will think about continuing the tradition.</description>
		<notes>The film has the singular blazon of being based on the story of a pope. The subject was in fact written for the theater by Karol Wojtyla when he was bishop in Krakow and exalts the Christian values ??of the family. Simple and pleasant, the film is well interpreted especially by Lancaster, the wise goldsmith.</notes>

		<description>In 1789, mistreated by the cruel Captain Bligh who imposes the strictest seafaring discipline, the crew of a sailing ship of Her Britannic Majesty rebels led by the second officer, Fletcher Christian. The rioters land on an island in Polynesia but, tracked down by the cruel Bligh, many of them are forced to pay for their mutiny. It is the third time that this story has been brought to the screen and, once again - apart from the adventurous breath of the places, the sea and the happy islands of the South Seas - the interest is based on the clash of two strong personalities. Mel Gibson has more space, but bad Hopkins is better.</description>

He then leaves for Chicago where he is hired as a player by a greedy and disreputable elderly couple. Cully's luck seems to have no boundaries, so much so that the boy decides to risk it on his own in the club of a certain George Cole, whose stripper wife he ends up falling in love with. From here on, Cully is involved in increasingly murky situations until he realizes that the game has become too heavy for him. Excellent cast, but the rest is not convincing.</description>

		<description>Jimmy Doyle, of the New York narcotics team, frowned upon by superiors for his unorthodox methods, is on the trail of a major drug trade. After a partial failure, the case is taken away from him, but he continues the investigation. When he is finally able to achieve an important result, not all goes well.</description>
		<notes>One of the best detective stories ever, directed with a sure hand by the specialist Friedkin. The very long sequence of the chase between the car and the subway is memorable. Hyperreal context where the boundaries between "good" and "evil" seem non-existent: the policeman is a violent pervert, the drug dealer a refined European. Redesigned the geography of the noir and the gangster movie. Several controversies followed the distribution, given the violence of some scenes. Five Oscars: Best Film, Best Director, Best Lead Actor (the talented Hackman, launched by this film), editing and screenplay. With a good following, directed by John Frankenheimer.</notes>

		<description>From New York, agent Jimmy Doyle is sent on a mission to Marseille, on the trail of drug trafficker Charnier who escaped capture in the previous film. Immediate disagreements with the French police, which Doyle accuses of ineptitude. The boss has Doyle caught and filled with drugs; energetically detoxified, this time the policeman closes the account.</description>
		<notes>Definitely a good following. After the great critical and public success of the first "French connection", director Friedkin was offered the sequel. He refused and passed the hand to the excellent Frankenheimer. Two main innovations: Popeye Doyle this time works away, and overall there is less violence than the model, even if the drug scenes are very strong. Instead, we insist on the incognito character of the cop. The dubbing eliminates many of the verbal gags (English-French), of which the policeman's attempt to drink a bourbon at the bar remains. There is also a negligible "Violent Arm of Law 3" made for TV and without Gene Hackman.</notes>

		<description>The great painter Van Gogh told for better or for worse, in his artist's madness, in his brilliant schizophrenia. Contrasted to a rational Gauguin, Van Gogh is inspiration in person, he is the maximum of sensitivity and emotionality. The director retraces the main events of his life (the relationship and then the break with Gauguin, the family, the cut of the ear) in a perspective of "diversity", where art and madness travel parallel.</description>
		<notes>An excellent film, in its unpleasantness and in the courage with which it faces the subject; often in symbiosis with Van Gogh's painting, with beautiful music and two splendid leading actors (Quinn won the Oscar for his interpretation of Gauguin).</notes>

		<description>Jim Douglas wants to avenge his wife who was raped and killed by some bandits. Convinced that the culprits are four outlaws escaped when they were about to be hanged for a robbery, he sets out on their trail and begins his work of extermination. Only after killing three of them will he discover that he has gone after the wrong people. The avenger theme is one of the most recurrent in western filmography. Here, Jim Douglas' mistake introduces the variant of justice betrayed, but after it all took place in the context of the epic of revenge. Well performed, the film uses a very respectable narrative.</description>

		<description>Forced with blackmail by the Council of Ten, which governs Venice, a gentleman takes on the role of the executioner. With him, the powerful of the city secretly solve all the cases that do not want to be publicized. The assignment is hateful, but it becomes completely unsustainable when the man is confronted, as the next victim, with his own son. The production commitment for a film shot in the period of cinematographic autarchy is discreet. Between conspiracies, killings and betrayals, the script is not so much for the subtle.</description>

		<description>On Christmas Eve in Milan, a young industrialist returns to his nice apartment in the center where his girlfriend is waiting for him. Man is obsessed with a thought: how far can you blow into a balloon without breaking it? After numerous tests and after having asked for help without results even from an engineer friend, our hero also quarrels with his girlfriend. Left alone at home with his dog, he sits down at the table. One last attempt: at the umpteenth explosion he takes a run and throws himself out the window. An absolutely brilliant Ferreri invents this very acidic metaphor on alienation, supported by a great Mastroianni and a spicy Spaak.</description>

		<description>Brenda Starr is the heroine of a famous comic. One of her designers one day decides that she can't take it anymore and tries to convince her to leave the world of comics to go with him in real life. Instead, the opposite happens and it is he who finds himself embroiled in one of the incredible adventures of his charming heroine. The cast is not bad and sports a dazzling Brooke "Barbie" Shields. The subject is not really original and the realization even more poor. Shot in 1986, the film was released only six years later. Even just looking at the first ten minutes, you can understand why.</description>

However, their attachment to their respective families leads them to break up after an unfortunate attempt at a loving encounter in a friend's house. David Lean stages this daily melodrama with great mastery: on an apparently realistic background unravels a nuanced succession of emotions, modesty, impulses and embarrassments.</description>

But they will be, in fact, illusions.</description>

He finally gets involved in an important case, or so he believes, because in reality he is used by his colleagues as a decoy. Despite everything, however, his contribution is decisive, but even more decisive becomes that of his wife, a virago champion of karate, between exchanges of person, quarrels and other tangles. To exhibit the longed-for recognition, however, the sergeant must give it to himself with the complicity of an usher.</description>

		<description>For some time a man has been haunted by a strange nightmare: a woman who is no longer young but very charming is walking in front of him, she is reached and at that point he himself tries to kill her. Is it just a dream, or is it something else? The doubt is atrocious, especially since the mysterious lady really exists, and the man begins to follow her feeling very attracted to her ... A lot of suspense and many twists for a traditional thriller, ideally dedicated to the master Alfred Hitchcock. To the point that the female interpreter is Tippi Hedren, protagonist of The birds and mother (in life) by Melanie Griffith.</description>

However, if at the beginning the succession of misfortunes keeps enough on the rope, after a while the story becomes mechanically predictable.</description>

A clash at the top between two comic attitudes: the sophisticated and "intellectual" one of Woody and the Italian-American and "macaronic" one of Nick Apollo Forte, a professional "crooner" (melodic singer) and brilliant entertainer. We laugh often, but bitter implications are not lacking: Allen draws a parable about ephemeral success and loyalty. Mia Farrow also lends her side well to a funny role. To remember the sequence of the Italian party, with Woody more confused than ever.</notes>

		<description>Frank is often forced to leave his daughter Candice with his grandmother Juliana. His wife Nola is being treated by Dr. Raglan, an advocate of the "psychoplasmic" theory. One day monstrous murders begin to occur: the first victim is Juliana. A certain Jan Hartog puts Frank on the right track: it is Nola who, under Raglan's "guidance", is giving birth to horrible murderous monsters. It is the film that made Cronenberg known in Italy. There we already find the theme dear to him of the human body seen as a sort of generator of monstrosity and the ability to narratively use the most horrifying special effects.</description>

		<description>Appointed warden of Wakefield prison, Harry Brubaker is locked up there under a false name and discovers that there is plenty of rottenness inside the penitentiary. Throwing off the mask, he initiates courageous reforms, pursues the violent and corrupt settlers in the administration. But, when he discovers the bodies of some prisoners tortured to death and secretly buried, a powerful state senator decides it is time to fire him to stop the dangerous scandal.</description>
		<notes>Inspired by the real misadventures of Tom Morton, director of an Arkansas penitentiary in the late 1960s. Entertainment and civil commitment, with Redford in his golden years.</notes>

But when the four discover that they are the protagonists of a sentimental "quadrangle", they decide to do things in the open, forming two new families. After a few months, the so mixed couples meet again ...</description>
		<notes>Giorgio Capitani, not new to this type of operation, tries, in vain, to update the themes of the pochade, failing miserably. Boring and fake, like the modest Po Valley worker played by Catherine Spaak, no longer a teenager and still far from television successes.</notes>

Despite the presence of James Cagney and the direction of Howard Hawks, this film is not to be counted among the milestones in the history of cinema.

		<description>With skill and cynicism Jonathan Shields establishes himself as a film producer, but his boundless presumption ruins him. Determined to make up for it, he has the nerve to ask an actress, a director and a screenwriter, who in the good old days he had "used" and hurt with ruthlessness, to go back to work for him.</description>
		<notes>With this happy ending drama Minnelli draws one of the cruellest and at the same time most sympathetic portraits in the world of Hollywood, with a capital interpretation of Douglas. Oscar for scenography, costumes, photography, screenplay and supporting actress (Gloria Grahame).</notes>

The shrewd lover resigns himself from the bakery where he worked and induces Berta into prostitution. Then one day the girl meets Piero, a shy student who strikes her for the delicacy with which he treats her.</description>
		<notes>Based on the novel "Bubu de Montparnasse" by Charles Philippe, which at the time had a certain success in the circles of "counterculture", a psychological excavation that Bolognini does not always manage to make the best of. Very good actors, theatrically "alienated".</notes>

		<description>During the war of independence against the British, General Jackson allies himself with the buccaneers commanded by Jean Lafitte, who are decisive in destroying the English fleet. Lafitte obtains immunity for himself and his men and is welcomed as a triumph. But then it turns out that his men had boarded an American ship and the crowd wants a lynching. Jackson keeps his promises and leaves him free to leave, alone and disconsolate, with his ship. Last film in which Cecil DeMille, the creator of the blockbuster, put his hand (he died shortly after). The direction is signed by Anthony Quinn, then his son-in-law. Funny and colorful adventures of filibusta.</description>

		<description>Professor Victor Roth, of Jewish origin, is celebrating his sixtieth birthday with his family. Suddenly the radio announces that Hitler has been appointed chancellor. It is the beginning of the end: the professor, arrested, will die in a concentration camp and his daughter, while trying to take refuge in Austria, will be killed by her ex-boyfriend, who has passed into the ranks of the SS.</description>
		<notes>Clearly anti-Nazi propaganda film shot before the US entered the war, it tells, through the drama of a family, the historical political climate of Hitler's seizure of power. But the director Borzage was also interested in investigating the strength of feelings, represented by the love of his daughter.</notes>

But one day he meets Daisy, a circus artist, falls in love with her and leaves his wife for her; he also neglects work, causing serious personal and professional problems. The result is a chain of events that determines the rapid and inexorable evolution of the story in increasingly dark colors.</description>
		<notes>Popular Mélo, with a romantic story that leads to a drama with strong colors, directed with pure craft by an honest craftsman. Luckily there is Jean Gabin to give depth to the unfaithful doctor, while Silvana Pampanini is the circus acrobat and Carla Del Poggio his wife.</notes>

		<description>Alphonse (Gérard Depardieu), unemployed and the only inhabitant, with his wife, of a thirty-story skyscraper in the Défense, starts a conversation with a stranger in the Parisian suburban subway; shortly thereafter he finds out that he was murdered with his own knife. It is only the first episode of an incomprehensible series of murders Alphonse went through in the company of a strangler and a policeman, shocked and not always innocent witnesses. Bertrand Blier guides us on a disturbing and absurd journey into the metropolitan nightmare, seasoned with an unusual black humor that borders on surrealism. We laugh, even often, but with shivers down my spine.</description>

But the previously abandoned parents have reconstructed what happened and they all fall together in Venice. Renato is forced to disappear again.</description>

Another curiosity of the film is the presence of Orson Welles in the role, congenial to him, of the narrator. Too bad that his big voice cannot be heard in the dubbed version.

		<description>In 1932 in Alabama all the hardships caused by the Great Depression are still noticeable. The young sons of a lawyer spend their days trying to enter the "haunted house", where a mentally ill lives. The father defends a black man unjustly accused of violence by a farmer: the racist court still condemns him and he tries to escape and ends up killed. Meanwhile, the farmer would like to take revenge on the lawyer and ambush him.</description>
		<notes>Delicate reenactment of a contradictory era in American history, from a famous Harper Lee novel adapted by Horton Foote. One of the best interpretations of Peck, supported by the sober direction of Mulligan. Particle for rookie Robert Duvall, Oscar for screenplay, scenography and (obviously) Gregory Peck.</notes>

		<description>Maestro Garetti (Vittorio De Sica) has a wife, four children and little money. He agrees to be a tour guide to an Indian prince during his stay in Rome and the latter, as a reward, gives him a small elephant. The animal wreaks havoc in the neighborhood and for Garetti the consequences are serious: he must in fact pay damages for damages. When the zoo director buys the pachyderm, everything is fine.</description>
		<notes>The master played by De Sica seems a bit like the parody of the retired professor of "Umberto D" in a film with a very strange cast: in fact there is also Sabù, a child, at the time very famous for a successful series of English films .</notes>

		<description>Sam Clayton is good, kind, so ready to help others that he risks going bankrupt. He lent the money to buy a new apartment. The proceeds from a charity party are stolen from him as he is about to pay it to the bank. And the bank does not trust to give him a loan. In the end everything settles down. It ends like the Goat movies, but McCarey is strangely uninspired and the pace isn't irresistible.</description>

		<description>Lisetta, a professional in mercenary love, favors a group of sexual maniacs in the exercise of her services. Filippo Maria, on the other hand, is a young astronomy scholar, clumsy and bungling. The film follows the events of the two protagonists in parallel for a certain time, then, from the moment of their meeting, it knots the two paths into a single plot and makes our lovebirds marry. The inconsistency of the events is accompanied by the stupidity of the dialogues. The director uses every pretext to show nakedness and to insist on it pleased.</description>

		<description>Carla, during the war, quickly had a relationship with three American soldiers: from this situation was born Gia, whom the three fathers, unbeknownst to each other, keep in a Swiss boarding school. Carla cleverly manages to keep up with the game and, to justify herself in the eyes of her fellow villagers, she claims to be the widow of an elusive Major Campbell. But things change when the three "fathers" arrive in town with lots of wives in tow. Gina Lollobrigida's American adventure was neither lasting nor memorable. This film is perhaps the best that could be sewn on the Italian diva export format.</description>

		<description>A television programmer thinks he has become cynical after watching cruel footage. Disinterested in everything, he does not accept a friend's request for help, convinced that he is being persecuted. However, when the latter is found dead, the protagonist's patina of cynicism cracks.</description>
		<notes>The title with which the film was released was originally this: "Good news or the personality of the victim". Fortunately, they shortened it, because it was enough to make it clear how pretext and cumbersome the story was. Perhaps the worst film by the author of "The Working Class Goes to Heaven", unfortunately also the last.</notes>

		<description>While the Civil War rages on, Biondo, Tuco and Sentenza, three disreputable individuals, reluctantly get together to find a treasure in gold coins, hidden in a tomb. Two of them know part of the secret to finding the place beyond enemy lines, the third is unscrupulous and can be useful in the enterprise. The agreement is difficult to maintain: the hunt is done by the three separately, but by supervising each other, until the decisive confrontation in the cemetery.</description>
		<notes>Picaresque and epic, very long and messed up, full of memorable images and jokes: "every gun has its own voice, and I know this one". The final three-way duel is memorable, as usual Morricone's music is splendid.</notes>

		<description>Mary lives in New York and works as a waitress; she returns to Italy called by her husband and upon his arrival she discovers him involved in very shady deals. He relies on a gruff lawyer (Celentano) he met on the plane. He, in spite of himself, helps her and naturally ends up falling in love with her, reciprocated. The lawyer and the bad guy arrive at the final battle also to contend for the woman. The Celentano trend has raged in Christmas programming for about ten years. The bizarre and grumpy character cut out by the singer, in this film is now worn and patched up. Castellano and Pipolo scrape the bottom of the barrel.</description>

		<description>A group of strangers arrive in a quiet suburban neighborhood who settle into an old Victorian house and behave very strangely. They only go out at night, dig large holes under the moon and receive no visitors. Then Peterson, who is a neighbor and spends his vacation at home, is persuaded to make a foray into the villa. This venture will cost him dearly: he will be the victim of an explosion, but along the way to the hospital he will discover the secret.</description>
		<notes>Joe Dante directs The Neighbor's Grass with great gusto, making it a mockery of life in the suburbs of big American cities. There is also a longer version of the film.</notes>

		<description>Burro is the nickname given by the villagers to a simpleton big boy. A man of toil in a cinema, he falls in love with an actress seen on the screen and sees her in every woman he meets: once a devoted peasant, another a gypsy who does not hesitate to take advantage of her naive passion. Disappointed, he changes jobs, then discovers that the one who believed his father in reality is not: alternating nonsense, hermeticism and pathetism in a cold and alienated atmosphere, unusual for Pozzetto, fresh from the international success of Da grande. Directed with some "virtuosic" excesses on the subject and screenplay by Tonino Guerra.</description>

		<description>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are train robbery specialists. Hunted by a Union Pacific patrol, they expatriate to Bolivia with Etta, a teacher in love with Sundance, where they continue their business for a while. But when they decide to abandon the robberies, fate awaits them at the gate.</description>
		<notes>The director of "La stangata" reinterprets the end of the epic of the West in a sometimes grotesque and disillusioned key. The last romantic outlaws of that period are portrayed as two slightly immature, rogue adventurers, always ready to throw themselves headlong into trouble. Behind history a pinch of '68, the protest and even the "call" of South America (where Butch also went in reality). A film that made history, a tandem of actors in a state of grace and a jumble of awards during the Night of the Stars: Oscar to the screenplay by Bill Goldman, photography, music and the song "Raindrops Keeps Fallin'on My Heart" by Burt Bacharach who became a smash. A film that is certainly important, enjoyable and perhaps a little dated. The elegy of Peckinpah's "Pat Garret and Billy the Kid" is, however, another matter entirely.</notes>

		<notes>Sometimes naive comedy, with some dated elements but still endowed with a remarkable freshness. In his second film, Coppola (also screenwriter, from a novel by David Benedictus) anticipates some of the themes of _The Graduate_ but, compared to Mike Nichols, he chooses a lighter tone. Lovin 'Spoonful songs, beat environments and nostalgia for the pop world. The film also marks Karen Black's debut.</notes>

		<description>We are in the 1930s, in a silver mine on the border between Arizona and Nevada. Jess, in charge of being the guardian, is taken aback by the sudden return of his 17-year-old daughter who, long ago, had moved away from the family. The man's surprise is even stronger when he realizes that the girl tries to seduce him. Jess very soon succumbs to the flattery of the girl and thus begins, after some uncertainty, a relationship. Also because the man is not sure he is the father. However, the case ends up in court.</description>
		<notes>One of the latest performances by Orson Welles, in the role of a judge. The subject is taken from a novel by James Cain (the one about the "Postman always rings twice"). It is meant to be a morbid film, it's just boring.</notes>

All that remains is the divorce, also because everyone has already found a way to console themselves with a new love. But Paolo and Sandra really love each other, and so they become lovers ... Once upon a time there was Milan to drink, the Milan of fashion and advertising, of via Montenapoleone and easy money. The director Oldoini, after Belli fresco's American trip, threw himself into describing the glossy and fatuous world of photomodels, but only to create an opera in harmony format.</description>

		<description>Anna and Poppy Rose (Batsy Drake and Cary Grant) have three little children. If Poppy is worried about a family budget that is certainly not pharaonic, the very generous Anna agrees to take care of another girl and, later, even a little cripple. Many difficulties arise, but, over time, also the joys of a peaceful and happy coexistence. More than the structure of the story, quite obvious in its march towards an outcome of general satisfaction, it is worth the presence of leading figures who get the best out of every situation. In any case, the film gave rise to a successful television "serial" in the USA.</description>

		<description>Camillo and Adelaide are on their honeymoon in England and are struggling to find a place to sleep. More than anything else they are lost and the only refuge looks like a castle in the middle of the fog. During the night, the two discover that the castle is haunted by the spirit of the old baron, a hilarious spirit, a joker and above all dedicated, as far as he can, to the pleasures of the flesh. The idea is similar to that of Rocky Horror. The sequel, however, is not on par with Sharman's film and Carati herself does not even reach the acting levels of her subsequent porn period. Both she and the eternal Montagnani are unwatchable.</description>

		<description>Kay, widowed and handsome, is about to marry Rupert, an Egyptologist by profession. She decides to return to live in the house where she lived with her first husband, Jolly. She is quite surprised when the ghost of these begins to appear to her at all times. He tries them all, even exorcisms, in vain. Only after learning about his past, which is a little too much of a butterfly, does he find the strength to free himself from it. An all-star cast for Robert Mulligan, who engages in the fantastic comedy genre: the story is openly inspired by Bruno Barreto's film "Donna Flor and her two husbands". It echoes the style of classic American comedy of the 1930s and 1940s, and the result is dignified, even if Barreto's film was better.</description>

Noodles, in love with Deborah, ends up in prison and comes out of it during Prohibition. The gang continues to do a golden business, but little by little the relationship between Max and Noodles is deteriorating. One day, Max is killed in a firefight: by now Noodles is truly alone, but thirty years later he receives a letter ... A true "film-testament" of Leone, who pours his personal love for cinema into it. of big Hollywood with absolute impetuosity and devotion. A fresco that is both epic and realistic, "mythological" and melancholic.</description>
		<notes>An immense work that plays with Time and Memory (of a man and a country), Sergio Leone's latest masterpiece had a mocking destiny: Time played with him, taking us, almost 30 years after his creation, a (nth) version with an unpublished montage, in whose fabric 6 sequences cut from the European edition have been stitched up (thanks to the skilful work of the Immagine Ritrovata di Bologna, with funding from Gucci and Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation) of 1984. Twenty-six minutes in all: little thing, compared to the epochal duration of the film, which also, through the inevitable signs that time has left on the film, are able to make a gigantic work even bigger.</notes>

Gangsters, local police and American agents get him a lot of trouble, but even the "relatives" who cover him are not joking.</description>
		<notes>Crackling comedy supported by a nervous montage, good dialogue and actors who are good in the part; it is an opportunity to see Mireille Darc again at the peak of her splendor. Michel Constantin, a former Renault worker and former captain of the French volleyball team, was more often an outlaw than a policeman in the cinema.</notes>

		<description>Three individuals, including the psychopath and very dangerous Alan, blackmail an industrialist whose wife wants to get involved in politics at all costs: they film his encounters with a beautiful girl, their accomplice, and then have him witness her murder, accomplished with his gun. The man, however, maintaining an incredible calm and coldness, does not succumb to the trap of the criminals. Not even when his wife is raped and kidnapped. He has his own plan to save himself: he manages to cunningly set the three against each other and finally sets a mocking and deadly trap for the survivor Alan.</description>
		<notes>John Frankenheimer is not a rookie (among his works we remember "Go and kill", "Seven days in May"): the suspense is skillfully constructed, the direction is nervous and particularly effective and together they give rise to a successful film of its kind.</notes>

		<description>In the year 1900, the Boxers revolt rages in Beijing. Matt Lewis arrives in town in command of a detachment of marines tasked with defending the US embassy. All the foreign delegations, gathered to protect themselves better, are soon under siege. Lewis organizes the resistance and tries some action against the rioters, but only after almost two months, with the arrival of reinforcements, the fate of the conflict is reversed.</description>
		<notes>Superproduction directed in the most critical decade of his career by a Nicholas Ray forced to leave the set in progress, the film is a vast historical fresco, of undoubtedly spectacular effectiveness.</notes>

But the airport is "seized" by a group of terrorists, led by a former special forces officer, who does not hesitate to shoot down a plane full of passengers to pursue his purpose: to land and withdraw, thus saving him from a well-deserved trial. a South American dictator. McClane resolves the situation.</description>
		<notes>More than the sequel to "Crystal Trap" this can be considered the second chapter. One of the rare cases where the second part works as well as the first. In the film there are something like 264 corpses. Special effects at will.</notes>

		<description>Tinto Brass, light years away from the erotic cinema that made it famous, offers an overview of the main events of the twentieth century. From the October revolution to the Mexican one, from the Great War to the invasion of China by the Japanese, from the Spanish War to the Second World War, from the Nazi madness to the death camps, to the dropping of the two atomic bombs on Japan. In short, there is no historical event that has escaped this skilful work of editing stock images.</description>

		<description>Boone is a boy tormented by terrifying nightmares and for this he is being treated by a psychiatrist, Dr. Decker. His troubled mind pushes him to search for the mysterious location of Midian, which soon discovers that it is a cemetery home to all the monstrosities of the world. Encouraged by the evil psychiatrist, the police also arrive and kill the boy. But the latter "resurrects" discovering that he is a mythical figure destined for a mission of salvation.</description>
		<notes>Clive Barker gained popularity thanks to "Hellraiser". His world of monstrous nightmares gets complicated here, being the better monsters than men. The psychiatrist is director David Cronenberg.</notes>

		<description>In Caboblanco, Peru, a treasure lies at the bottom of the sea. These are the war raids by the Nazis in churches and synagogues all over Europe. A handful of shady adventurers, including an alcoholic doctor, a former Nazi hierarch, a corrupt policeman, a mysterious Frenchwoman and a prostitute with a heart of gold try by all means to recover the loot. However, it is the owner of a night club, at first cynical and aloof, who intervenes to give a lesson to the Nazi hierarch and his corrupt accomplices.</description>
		<notes>The film, right from the title, is a vague undeclared remake of "Casablanca", but the overall result is rather modest.</notes>

		<description>In 1984, Red October, the most sophisticated atomic submarine of the USSR, leaves on a mission whose meaning the Americans manage to decipher. Until Jack Ryan of the CIA senses that Commander Ramius intends to desert and hand over the submarine to the Americans. But the Soviets also understood the project and set out on the trail of Red October to destroy it. Ryan drops by helicopter into the Dallas Underwater Unit, commanded by Bart Mancuso, and the chase begins. But Ramius is too good to get caught.</description>
		<notes>First film appearance of Jack Ryan, the character created by Tom Clancy made famous by Harrison Ford in "Power Games" and "Under the Sign of Danger". Action movie fans will not be disappointed.</notes>

		<description>Il Gatto, a former high-profile thief, lives quietly on the French Riviera, when a series of thefts carried out with his technique make the police suspicious. The man tries to find out who is trying to get him into trouble. At the same time, a rich and beautiful American who is in love with him comes after him, in turn convinced that these new thefts are his work. The truth, linked to the adventurous past of the "Cat", will come out during a luxurious masquerade party. The themes are Hitchcock's recurring ones: the false culprit, the suspect. But here the yellow fades into the comedy, thanks to a wonderful Grace Kelly.</description>

		<description>We are in 1942, in Lisbon. Joe Jackson is an American night club owner, Hannah Winter is a singer who ends up in the midst of a Nazi conspiracy. The Germans plan to kidnap the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who were residing in Portugal at the time. Joe and Hannah try together to prevent the sensational kidnapping, but a shrewd German general notices it and catches them in a nutshell ... The reference is Casablanca, even if the story then takes other paths. The cast is of a certain authority, Robert Wagner is all dressed in white and Clive Donner at the time also did Ciao Pussycat.</description>

Only Sheriff Calder tries to keep the use of reason, but his intervention is useless.</description>
		<notes>Penn creates with this torrid film a bitter and merciless fresco of the deep American province, of its inhabitants, of moral corruption and of the fanaticism that would like to mask it. The characters are well outlined by the script and Brando and Redford are towering.</notes>

The horse naturally loses. The punishment of the boss will be terrible: each of the two can have their lives saved only if they manage to kill the other.</description>
		<notes>Foray into black humor by a horror specialist: Brian De Palma. Perhaps this is why the film was not a great success, but the sequence in which De Vito goes to start the boss's car, fearing that a bomb is connected to the ignition, is an anthology.</notes>

		<description>Joey O'Brien works in a used car dealership: in order not to be fired he must be able to sell at least ten in one day; in addition, he is separated from his wife and his daughter worries him with her casual behavior. But all this is nothing, because that day, good Joey will have to contend with the crazy (and jealous) husband of his secretary, who breaks into the dealership armed with a machine gun.</description>
		<notes>Praise of the seller? Maybe yes, although this time Joey has to use all his clever persuasive art to save his life and that of the other hostages: isn't advertising the soul of commerce?</notes>

		<description>The breakthrough of Soviet troops on the German front is intertwined with the story of a foundry worker and his love for a teacher. In the foreground are the two historical antagonists of the affair, Stalin and Hitler. In the background the love between the two young people who will meet in Berlin. Propaganda film that makes extensive use of actors-double of historical characters, the most famous of which is Mikhail Gelovani in the role of Stalin. Despite the negative criticisms from around the world, Italo Calvino liked the film: "It is the story of war as it could have been imagined by a pastor of Tashkent". Which is not necessarily a praise.</description>

		<description>WWI. Lucilla di Torrebruna goes to visit her father who commands a regiment engaged in the battle of Caporetto. The father dies and Lucilla takes over his place, performing gestures of valor and covering herself with honor. She falls prisoner of the Austrians, but before they have time to deport her, she is saved by her fiancé Franco. Shortly after, Italy ended the conflict victorious. A lot of rhetoric and a splash of neorealism: the peasants were chosen from among the real inhabitants of the area, clips of period documentaries were used for the battle scenes.</description>

Dressed in feminine clothes he sneaks into the woman's house. Many will be mocked, but Lidio will face a very harsh and humiliating punishment.

		<description>In the sixth century after Christ, Theodoric, king of the Goths, died in Ravenna and was succeeded by Queen Amalasunta, the prefect of Rome, Cetego decided to take advantage of the situation to free Italy. After having circumvented the sovereign, obtaining, under a false pretext, permission to strengthen the wall defenses by enlisting troops and relying on the rivalry that divides her from her sister Amalafrida, he causes the latter to kill Amalasunta. In his place, Vitige, the new king of the Goths, was elected from Byzantium an army under the orders of Belisarius who intends to join the army of Cetego.</description>
		<notes>The film is inspired by the novel of the same name by Felix Dahn. Siodmak was in sharp decline, the production was elephantine, the film was divided into two parts for a total of almost three hours, which were halved to make a single film.</notes>

		<description>Satisfied with his job, his home and his money, 27-year-old Max Baron looks accomplished but collapses when his wife dies. He begins to drift from one bar to another: in one of these he meets the forty-year-old Nora Baker, also on the avenue of sunset after the loss of her son. A furious passion breaks out between them, which turns into love, however threatened by their respective character and social mistrust.</description>
		<notes>An adult drama that thrives on contrasts: religious, class, culture, age. The two protagonists learn to combine passion with distrust, in the name of love. Susan Sarandon's interpretation is really excellent.</notes>

In Reno, at the MGM Grand Hotel, there are the Toledo Tigers and the title is up for grabs.</description>
		<notes>Swan Song by Robert Aldrich, in its final rehearsal. An imperfect film, but dominated by the usual violent tones of America that the director hates. The one who stifled the Dream under the dollars and the business ... Sore Peter Falk, splendid the rest of the cast made up of character actors.</notes>

		<description>Hotel on the coast: four couples converge there to spend a weekend. There is the separated and sour couple who cares about their daughter becoming an adult (with an aged and sophisticated Jane Fonda, engaged in a very entertaining ping-pong dialogue); there is the husband who is discovered by his wife during an escapade; there is the gigolo with particular tastes who accompanies his actress wife to the Oscars ceremony and also two black doctors with their respective spouses who fight over tennis issues. A futile film, but directed with a polite hand by Herbert Ross, the former dancer, and interpreted in a very sparkling way.</description>

For a computer breakdown, Cruchot is promoted and can bully former superior Gerber, but the parties are turned upside down when the mistake comes to light. Another series of misunderstandings will then allow the sergeant to capture a fugitive and obtain, together with the promotion, the hand of the ambitious beloved. Louis De Funès, with his extraordinary grumpy mask, was the most popular French comedian of the seventies, rarely indulged, as in this case, by screenplays at the height of his potential.</description>

		<description>John Sullivan and Christy Colleran are two television journalists, divorced, but still linked by deep affection. When Christy decides to remarry, her ex-husband, with the excuse of an important scoop, forces her to return to work. This is the umpteenth version of Ben Hecht's comedy "First Page", updated by bringing the story from the world of print to that of television: in the change of "media" (like a husband) the film loses. On the other hand, Ted Kotcheff (director of "Rambo") is not Billy Wilder and he does not have his corrosive vision of the world, which is essential to avoid falling into farce.</description>

		<description>In 1907 the Englishwoman Lucy, belonging to a noble family with austere Victorian costumes, arrives in Italy with a crowd of relatives and friends over whom her rigid cousin Charlotte "reigns". In Florence, at the Bertolini pension, she was promised a room with a view of the Arno. The room, however, is not available because it is occupied by other Englishmen, the Emersons, who still accept the change. A love is born between Lucy and the young son of the Emersons, George, thanks to the natural and artistic beauties of the Tuscan capital. To fully live her sentiment, Lucy has to overcome the scandal of the breakup of the official engagement with the noble Cecil, chosen by the family. Lucy finds the strength to resist and the repressive Victorian morality is defeated.</description>

		<description>In Nantes, in 1955, the shipyards went on strike. François, a worker who has rented a room from a colonel's widow, is approached one night by a woman, Edith, who drags him into overwhelming love. Edith, who is the widow's daughter, is married to a helpless and jealous man who cuts his throat in front of her. But the tragedy will also involve the other protagonists. Jacques Demy, a very unique director, has created the film on a story of unusual gloom for him, but the fact that it is entirely set to music and sung upset the drama and realism of the context in derision and breaks the emotion instead of sublimating it.</description>

		<description>A man would like to be a cameraman to win over a beautiful MGM employee. His videos are random, but a monkey will accidentally film his act of heroism and he will conquer the beauty. Buster Keaton's first feature film: a masterpiece. Cinema as a technical reproducibility, as an avant-garde art, as an industry. The Man with the Camera, like Dziga Vertov. The two lovers, Hollywood and the madding crowd, like The Day of the Locust. A brilliant theoretical essay, and a perfectly paced film punctuated by unforgettable gags (Keaton playing all the roles of a baseball game alone, the vertical movement that accompanies him as he climbs the stairs to answer the phone).</description>

To punish him for an alleged betrayal, Ofelia improvises herself as a truck driver. The squalor of the film is singular even in the joke-movie genre.</description>

		<notes>A singular and interesting film, both for narrative structure and for interpretations. The parts into which it is divided constitute two films in one: the first picaresque and surreal, the second claustrophobic and corrosive game of slaughter in a train compartment. And even the happy ending can seem like a paradox.</notes>

		<description>Tonino Russo, from a very humble family, was included in the Camorra because he proved to be strong and confident. Little by little he abandoned his old friendships and made a career in the criminal organization, arousing jealousy and envy among the other guappi. One of these tries to kill him, then kidnaps his little brother to blackmail him. But Tonino kills him in a rustic duel. Then he hands himself over to the police to prevent his little brother from believing him a hero and following him on the road to crime. Pasquale Squitieri demonstrates a good knowledge of the Camorra phenomenon, combined with a certain mastery of direction in action scenes.</description>

		<description>In the Poggioreale prison, the authority of a prisoner grows, known as "the professor", who manages to create a new and powerful Camorra organization. After escaping he goes to New York, where he receives the "investiture" from the top management of the Cosa Nostra. His undisputed authority also makes him necessary for the games of politics, in which his intervention is required even after returning to prison.</description>
		<notes>Inspired by the figure of Raffaele Cutolo, in the wake of the book by Giuseppe Marrazzo. Tornatore's first film, released at the time in general disinterest: a crude vision of the criminal and political context in which a boss can grow up. By now, almost a historical document. The best moments are those "over the top", poised between melodrama and western, and those in which Ben Gazzara reigns, as the claustrophobic finale.</notes>

		<description>In Mexico, a group of desperate people are recruited by an Austrian who pretends to support their cause, but in reality aims to turn the country into an Austrian colony. A bounty hunter goes in search of the leader of the rioters and, for some time, joins a group of Americans tasked with recovering a shipment of weapons stolen from the United States army. In the end, the bounty-killer will collect the bounty. Parody of revolutionary westerns, shot with very few means and with few ideas, it is one of the last Italian westerns. The protagonist is Gianni Garko, a theatrical actor who had become famous in the role of Sartana.</description>

		<description>On the day of Jack Ballard's wedding, four figures arrive at Silver Lode who are instructed, they say, by the federal government to arrest him for murder and transfer him to California. Jack, who has a good reputation in town, gets a two-hour delay to prove his innocence. Eventually he succeeds and even manages to find out who his real friends are. It's a western shot almost in "real time" (all the action lasts two hours), as well as High Noon that came out a couple of years earlier. But despite the obvious drawbacks, veteran Allan Dwan's film failed to repeat its success.</description>

O'Malley puts everything back in place: among other things, he persuades a millionaire to give his large building to the parish and also brings happiness back to a family of divided artists. After initial conflicts, the mother superior Sister Benedetta also gave him valid help, before falling ill with tuberculosis. Thanks to the presence of Crosby and Bergman, and the skill of Dudley Nichols (one of the great Hollywood screenwriters of the heyday), McCarey manages to find the right tone to tell this crybaby story of a religious milieu.</description>

		<description>Billy Flynn was a great boxing champion, but he had to retire because he suffered brain trauma. Now he is not doing well: he is a stable boy, he is full of debts for the habit of gambling, but he consoles himself with the love of his son, who lives with him after his parents have split up. The mother shows up and Billy decides to entrust the baby to her; then goes back to the ring to get the money he needs.</description>
		<notes>. Unworthy remake of King Vidor's eponymous film starring Wallace Beery. Zeffirelli's rhetoric and approximation have nothing to do with the old melodramas a la Matarazzo: here the feelings are dull and fake. Much better has been seen in the boxing environment. The child Ricky Schroder is unbearable.</notes>

		<description>We are in Johnson County, Wyoming, towards the end of the last century. The big ranchers are at war with immigrants from Eastern Europe, who reclaim the land that was promised to them. The peasants are defended by Sheriff Averill, while the ranchers are legalized by Averill's youth friend, Billy Irvine. The sheriff manages to organize the immigrants militarily and finally face the squadron of killers paid by the ranchers in a sort of pitched battle.</description>
		<notes>Made by Cimino after the extraordinary success of the Hunter, it is the film that certainly represented the point of maximum tension between auteur cinema and the commercial needs of the Hollywood system: when the balance has tilted towards the author, the first consequence is was the failure of the production company, the historic United Artists. After breaking through the budget, the film in fact did not make a penny at the box office (also because it was blatantly boycotted by the American market). The blow cost Cimino a few years of inactivity and a difficult return to the circuit that counts. It is a controversial, unrepeatable work, in many ways megalomaniac (the meticulous outdoor reconstructions, the majestic mass scenes), but with an exceptional lyrical force and a true "historical indignation" towards the official myth of America as a democratic mix of races.</notes>

		<description>David Summer, a young American professor, takes refuge with his wife in her hometown in England to devote himself to his math studies. Soon, also due to the coquetry of the woman, the man finds himself at the center of constant provocations by some local youngsters. Everything culminates in a real assault on the house, during which the professor puts his intelligence at the service of a ferocious self-defense.</description>
		<notes>Peckinpah on the attack in one of his most theoretical films, in which his pessimism towards social relations is clear, always influenced by the state of chaos that prevails in nature.</notes>

		<description>Captain Mark (Spencer) of the Los Angeles Task Force is about to go on vacation: he has planned a short camping period with the little family. Instead he has to deal with a thief, the slicked-back dude Tony Roma (Milian). But here comes a big mafioso (Lawrence) and the matter gets much more serious.</description>
		<notes>Basically there are only two variants compared to when the protagonist couple of the film is formed by Bud Spencer and Terence Hill: here, instead of the second, there is Tomas Milian and the two are opponents rather than partners. For the rest, everything is predictable and, in its own way, also pleasant.</notes>

		<description>The hotelier Elvira (De Filippo) and the pharmacist Don Filippo (Spadaro) are opponents in the elections in a small village. An old sentimental rust makes the quarrel more bitter, but the love between his daughter and her grandson changes everything, between comedy and sentimentality. Titina De Filippo (1898-1963) had just brought Filumena Marturano (1951), written for her by her brother Eduardo, to the big screen.</description>

		<description>Chihuahua (Mexico), 1750: the bandit León Alastray is saved from being chased by the police by a priest, Father José. Shortly after, the priest was sent as punishment to the village of San Sebastián, in full Indian territory. On the death of Don José, killed by a bandit, it will be Leon who takes his place.</description>
		<notes>A pseudo-western with a rich "budget" (with a background reminiscent of Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai") well done by Henri Verneuil, especially in the mass scenes. Among the performers, Anthony Quinn treads a little too much.</notes>

Before the war is over, he manages to get her pregnant, even if there is no mention of marriage. The young man marries an aristocrat who dies after a couple of years without leaving heirs. At that point the master father remembers his bastard nephew and forces his son into a belated shotgun wedding.</description>

		<description>More than a real film, an editing work that has distorted and recomposed, distorting two of Paolella's musical comedies, "Songs of half a century" and "Songs, songs, songs". A series of sketches and musical numbers interpreted by the former showmen, Sordi and Rascel, to which was added an episode with Ernesto Calindri and Adriano Celentano's clan.</description>
		<notes>Paolella's operation leaves a bad taste in the mouth and risks ruining even the memory of the two "massacred" films in slow motion. Good opportunity to see Calindri, who recently passed away and also an excellent actor for cinema.</notes>

		<description>Catwalk of songs interpreted by famous stars of the Sixties of Italian and French pop music, interspersed with sketches and striptease numbers filmed at Crazy Horse and Lido in Paris. A peak of provincialism and banality.</description>
		<notes>The film does not differ much from the classic model of "musicarielli", although it remains anchored to the style of the documentary. The most important singers of the time parade a little awkwardly in front of the camera. More than a musical, a rotogravure film. Few emotions, many vintage songs.</notes>

Old and alone, he decides to name his heirs the descendants of Lisa, the girl he loved in his youth who had preferred to marry an accountant. To get to know the chosen ones and understand how they would react, Fulton goes to live in disguise in their town, managing to get hired in the "store" of the family. Unusual little comedy by Douglas Sirk, which begins his collaboration with Rock Hudson. The lion's share is for Charles Coburn. Short appearance, among the customers of the shop, of a very tender James Dean.</description>

		<description>In the sentry box of a barracks a newborn is found with a note that attributes its paternity to an unidentified military man named Felice. In that barracks, however, more than one soldier bears that name and all have good reasons to believe they are the father of the child. The suspicions fall on a soldier who is about to be arrested, but the child's mother, who in the meantime has been able to leave the hospital, goes to the barracks and recognizes the father of the child in the surly corporal of the day. The narrative pretext is weak, the realization as well, the starting point is like an old Parisian pochade.</description>

		<description>ale Tramont is courted by the famous dancer Jerry Travers, but although she is attracted to him, she rejects him believing him to be married to a friend of hers. Indeed, to reinforce the rejection, he in turn marries another. Other misunderstandings are added, which gradually clear up and lead to the expected happy ending.</description>
		<notes>Among the most famous films of the couple Ginger Rogers-Fred Astaire, it is a musical with easy dialogue and lively rhythm, still fresh and enjoyable. Between elegant dresses and glittering ballrooms, the film is also remembered for some songs written by Irving Berlin that have remained memorable: _Cheek to Cheek_, a true classic, and _Top Hat, White Tie and Tails_, a tribute to the genre.</notes>

		<description>Marie, a rich girl but haunted by bad luck, is kidnapped as soon as she arrives in Mexico. In charge of the research is the detective Campana, who flounders without success. Things change when he is joined by an assistant haunted by bad luck. All sorts of things happen, but in the end the magnet of the common bad luck works. Hugely successful French comedy, entrusted to the inspiration of the two protagonists (who will be together in two other films). It was the film that was screened at the Statuto cinema in Turin when the fire occurred.</description>

		<description>Patricia Foster, an industrial spy who deals with cosmetic formulas, privately investigates the mysterious death of her brother on a ski slope in a popular tourist resort in Switzerland. She finds unexpected help from an Interpol agent who approaches her pretending to be a cynical agent dedicated to corporate espionage.</description>
		<notes>Frank Tashlin is justifiably best known director for his excellent work with comedians like Jerry Lewis or Bob Hope. "Caprice" is the penultimate film of his career. Even here, despite being a drama film, there is no shortage of gags to which Tashlin subjects a reluctant Doris Day, a little too worried about her behavior as a star.</notes>

		<description>After the conquest of the Moon, the American space agency is planning a mission to Mars. At the last moment, however, the astronauts already settled are brought down and taken to a secret military base in the Nevada desert: something went wrong and the mission was canceled. For public opinion, however, everything must remain unchanged, on pain of the loss of prestige of the nation. The astronauts are then forced to simulate, as on a movie set, a false landing on the Red Planet. On "return", however, the simulation also goes wrong and the missile disintegrates. What to do with the three "space heroes" now dead for everyone? Fortunately, a reporter caught the scam and some suspicious "incidents" put him on the right track.</description>
		<notes>Under the guise of a science fiction film, Hyams touches on a delicate subject: reason of state. Not to mention the ever-present theme of the image (that of every staging) which confers truth even to the unreal. Hyams confirms himself as a good author, particularly skilled in measuring the pace of action. Together with the subsequent "Atmosfera zero" and "Timecop" this film constitutes an ideal fantastic trilogy.</notes>

		<description>John Barratt, an English teacher on vacation in France, runs into the fallen Count Jacques de Gue, who is his perfect double. The meeting pushes them to celebrate but, when he wakes up, Barrett realizes that he is dressed like the count: he is also recognized by everyone as such and gradually he identifies himself with the figure of his double, until the dramatic finale. Director Hamer was one of the most controversial personalities of Ealing Studios: this film, drastically reworked by the changed production climate, is however an exemplary "stripping of the family structure", one of the director's favorite themes. Magnificent, of course, Guinness and Davis. From a novel by Daphne Du Maurier.</description>

The agent's tyrannical mother, however, does not agree at all: an Irish native with an Italian, and moreover of Sicilian origin? May it never be! And poor Danny is upset to the point of falling prey to dramatic nightmares. But fate has a nice surprise in store, for him and also ... for his mother.</description>

		<description>Near to die, in Porto Ercole in 1590, the painter Michelangelo Merisi known as Caravaggio is prey to hallucinations. Twenty years back we find Caravaggio in Rome, saved from a life of hardship by Cardinal Del Monte. So we follow his rise up to the episode that will mark his life: the tragic relationship with Ranuccio Tomassoni and with his lover, Lena. It is the story of "a homosexual, an artist and a murderer" says Jarman. But don't expect a quiet, fictionalized biography: pocket calculators are just one of the freedoms the director takes. Splendid actors and especially Tilda Swinton who became famous with Edward II and Orlando.</description>

		<description>Daughter of a Neapolitan ex-guappo, graduated in law, destined by her father to marry an aristocrat, Carmela (Allasio) is subject to a strange form of sleepwalking: at night she goes to the room of Totò (Manfredi), a young man who is completely indifferent and who is also an opponent of his parent. Turning to a doctor (Tedeschi) to clarify the reason for this embarrassing anomaly, Carmela understands that, in reality, Totò is the man she is unconsciously in love with.</description>
		<notes>The film is all characterized by "grace": without many pretensions, it is discreetly directed and discreetly interpreted; it's not very funny, but it's not boring either. In short, it lets itself be seen, just as the musical commentary, which includes motifs from well-known songs, can be heard.</notes>

		<description>Don José (Marais), brigadier of the gendarmes, is seduced by the beautiful and unscrupulous Sevillian cigar Carmen (Romance). He is so enamored that he favors her fellow smugglers, kills his commander out of jealousy and runs away with the woman to the mountains. Left in turn for the bullfighter Escamillo (Bertheau), Don José cannot bear the insult and, desperate, kills Carmen too. Accompanied by the famous music of Bizet's melodrama, the film is a spectacular reworking of the tragedy, notable above all for the interpretation of Viviane Romance.</description>

		<description>An English noble who works in Hollywood is fired and decides to commit suicide. His nephew Dennis is in charge of the funeral and gets in touch with the agency "Sentieri melodiosi", specialized in burials. The owner of the agency has planned, following the advice of a teenager, to send the corpses of illustrious people into space: a publicity stunt which, however, also aims to solve the excessive accumulation of burials. Other suicides follow, which do not block the infernal mechanism. It is the first Hollywood episode of one of the best directors of English free cinema, who has disappeared a few years ago.</description>

In the end the intervention of Tommy and Sandy becomes decisive and the whole convoy finally arrives at its destination.</description>

Protected by the soldiers, the caravan must contend with the Sioux, interested in the cargo, and with the fierce members of the League of Temperance. What's more, the confusion is increased by the intervention of the city militia determined to defend the precious bottles to the bitter end. After the melee in a sandstorm, everything is resolved with a plea bargain that allows, among other things, the Sioux to drain the champagne.</description>

		<description>Drunkard David on New Year's Eve receives a message: Edith, a sister of the dying Salvation Army, wants to meet him to try to redeem him. David refuses and appears to be killed in a fight. The "cart of death" arrives and the existence of David is traced, while his wife is trying to kill herself. The protagonist's repentance resolves the situation. From a novel by Selma Lagerlöf adapted by herself, a masterpiece of the history of cinema that admirably combines the fantastic element with the social fresco. Particularly noteworthy are the results of the experimentation in the language of images and the uncommon complexity of the narrative structure.</description>

Only Sue regrets and convinces her boyfriend, Tommy, to accompany Carrie to the graduation party. The two are elected queen of the evening, but a mocking joke by the evil Chris unleashes the revenge of Carrie, who in her transition to adolescence has acquired paranormal powers. Then, in the fire with which he punishes his mother, Carrie also dies. But that's not all ... Clever horror film, with a shocking ending that for years has been a model for anyone who practices this genre.</description>

Giulia's new partner is convinced by the analyst to live his own diversity serenely, but he begins to turn his attention to Caruso. Then everything works out. Since Francesco Nuti has chosen "do it yourself" for directing, the level of the films he plays has dropped a lot. Here too we laugh little and badly.</description>

They inadvertently start the tape; the archaeologist's voice pronounces the magic formula and the house is filled with demons awakened from a thousand-year sleep. There is something for everyone; first of all the three girls, of course, but then also their friends who find no escape from the forces of evil. Homemade with two lire and a passionate taste for cinema, the film that revealed Raimi's bizarre genius and constituted the first episode of a successful series that developed between horror and parody.</description>

		<description>A cop catches a homicidal psychopath. Convicted, he is put on the electric chair, but instead of dying the criminal "returns" with multiplied energies. From that moment on, the policeman's house will turn into a scene of heinous crimes. Many do not believe what is happening, but the curse launched by the murderer produces its effects. Low butchery and sluggish routine for this umpteenth by-product of the genre, which in the Italian title would like to claim distant kinship with the brilliant little film by Sam Raimi. Even the director who started it preferred to leave it to someone else.</description>

Everyone who previously lived there died tragically, but the inspector does not believe it is a mysterious curse. He will be able to convince himself otherwise, paying the price for his discoveries in person. Already the names of the protagonists (Lee, Cushing) are the best you can ask for in the horror genre. The direction elegantly mixes terrifying motifs with hints of black humor.</description>

		<description>Jim Blandings (Cary Grant), an advertiser, buys, against everyone's opinion, a house in the country for himself and his family, an investment which, however, turns out to be a disastrous deal. Jim is also in a crisis of ideas: he cannot find a slogan for a delicatessen and fears he will be fired.</description>
		<notes>The director of "Hellzapoppin", a masterpiece of surreal cinema, flanked by actors who are masters of humor, collaborates on the American myth of the house (and in Connecticut, too!) A gentle and bubbly comedy. Screenplay by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank. New Deal air.</notes>

		<description>Jane Lambert, a forty-year-old writer, falls in love with Bernard, a much younger boy than her. The two leave for a holiday in the south of France with friends but Bernard has to go away on business. It is actually an excuse: Bernard has another woman from whom he can have those children that Jane cannot give him. Jane then attempts suicide.</description>
		<notes>French critics have not been kind to this film, based on the novel by Madeleine Chapsal by the wife of Jean-Louis Trintignant, calling it "low literature". In fact, the emphatic dialogues and the melodramatic situation suggest this thesis. However, Jacqueline Bisset's interpretation is enjoyable.</notes>

		<description>Walter Flelding (Hanks) is a young and ambitious lawyer with musical interests, Anna (Long), is a violinist in a symphony orchestra. They love each other, but they have the problem of the house. A problem that for the moment hinders their entire love life. And here is a fantastic opportunity: a large villa with a park at a truly ridiculous price. But once the sumptuous mansion is occupied, the truth comes painfully to the surface: the fixtures fall, the walls collapse, the systems don't work. But the two young people do not give up and undertake the process of the necessary repairs. Rivers of dollars end up in various jobs and problems and stress risk permanently compromising their relationship. The comedy is of the smashing type, but it has many tired pauses: the director Richard Benjamin, already a likeable actor, fails to carry out an enterprise based basically on a single idea. Waste the liveliness of Tom Hanks and the freshness of Shelley Long.</description>

		<description>India, 1905. The Swadeshi nationalist movement is mobilizing to prevent the British from dividing the state of Bengal between Hindus and Muslims. Bimala, wife of Nikhil, an Indian landowner fascinated by Western culture, is attracted by the personality of Sandip, leader of a nationalist movement fiercely opposed to English domination. Unfortunately for her, she will discover Sandip's true nature too late.</description>
		<notes>From the novel of the same name by Rabindranath Tagore. Ray, who eliminates the narrator present in the novel, planned to put the novel into images since 1955. The Indian director contains the characters of Bimala and Nikhil almost always inside a room, giving life to a real drama from room. With extraordinary skill he manages to penetrate the intimacy of his characters.</notes>

Thus we come to our days and to the real estate troubles of Giorgio, a modest banker, eager to find a home to be able to marry his girlfriend, Candida. Unlikely but amusing vicissitudes will lead them at the right time, in the right place, to do the right thing.</description>

		<description>The days of the imprisonment of the Christian Democrat statesman, kidnapped and murdered by the Red Brigades in 1978. A controversial and contradictory work that overshadows the Moor political exponent to focus on the human drama. It is a provocative film that expresses a thesis that has been circulating for some time at the time of its release. An example of cinema-truth about the years of lead, it often reduces the protagonists, except for the central figure of Aldo Moro, to opaque caricatures. There remains an undoubted, accurate documentary research work and a truly extraordinary interpretation by Gian Maria Volonté.</description>

The experiment is about to succeed but before the "big step" there is a kind of repentance.

		<description>The film describes the years spent at the Naples conservatory and the tormented childhood love of Vincenzo Bellini (1801-1834) for Maddalena Fumaroli - the inspirer of the famous romance - who accompanies him in the shadows during the difficult beginnings of his career. Just the inclusion, wanted by Maddalena, of "Casta diva" in the "Norma" decrees its success and definitively consecrates the genius of the great musician.

		<description>Rosa, the granddaughter of a wealthy Venetian landowner, is linked to a vow of chastity made since she was a child. In practice, it was a maneuver against him to keep the family assets of which the father is usufructuary protected. Shocked by the court that a cousin makes for her, Rosa decides to become a nun and to donate everything to the church. The foul maneuver devised at this point by his father will have unexpected effects.</description>
		<notes>Salvatore Samperi has a poisoned tooth with the Venetian bourgeoisie and is relentless in denigrating them in films whose excesses he cannot control. Thus wasting any positive charge of his "whipping" and realizing only poor freaks.</notes>

		<description>In the countryside near New York, in the mid-nineteenth century, lives the rich descendant of a Dutch family. With his peasants he behaves like a slaveholder and his greatest desire is to have a son to continue the lineage. But his wife can't have it and he gets rid of it by poisoning her. She remarries, but her much-desired child dies after giving birth, while her economic fortune begins to decline.</description>

Faced with his insistence, Rosa goes to look for him at the hotel to dissuade him. Pietro surprises them, kills his rival and runs away. Caught and tried, he is acquitted because Rosa accuses herself of adultery. But when the lawyer reveals that Rosa lied, Pietro returns to her.</description>
		<notes>The best mèlo of Matarazzo and also his most famous film. A concentrate of murky passions that has not lost a shred of enamel. Behind the appearance of the cineromanzo, an awareness: destiny is a crazy variable.</notes>

Catherine marries Peter, but is disgusted by his crude behavior and his dangerous character and thus seeks comfort in the arms of other men. Meanwhile Orlov has fled and leads the Cossack revolt against the tyrant.</description>
		<notes>Remarkable - and also intense - historical biography that favors action and adventure but does not disdain a certain fidelity towards "facts". Giacomo Rossi Stuart is Kim's father.</notes>

		<description>The marriage between the German princess Catherine and Archduke Peter is evidently not a marriage of love. When Peter is proclaimed tsar of all the Russias, she becomes tsarina. And it is she who assumes power when Pietro slowly slips into madness.</description>
		<notes>It is the first English film for both Elisabeth Bergner and Paul Czinner, a Hungarian fleeing Nazism. It's a bit slow and dated, but the cast is great and the production design is by Vincent Korda. Too bad that Joseph Von Sternberg's "Empress Catherine" was also released the same year. Of course two Catherine at the same time were too many and the other Catherine was Marlene Dietrich.</notes>

He tries to get away with escaping to Mexico, but Ben follows him there too, despite the fact that he can't act under the aegis of legality. However, the two soon find themselves having to make a common front against a new enemy ...</description>
		<notes>Light-hearted blend of westerns and comedy based on a Louis L'Amour novel. The strange combination works enough, but not so much to make the whole story enjoyable. Brynner; Crenna and Nimoy ("Spock") vouch for the professionalism of the cast.</notes>

		<description>Justin Thorne is a favorite teacher of his students, as well as a happy husband. For Jennifer Carter, however, it is something more: she adores the professor, she would like to take him to bed and, in her diary, she even goes so far as to report the details of their imaginary love affairs. After several refusals Justin falls for it and gets a rape trial in which he will be found guilty. First vision Tv It seems almost a male paranoid fantasy, while in reality it is a real case that happened in Australia in the 60s. George Miller is not that of Mad Max, he is just a namesake and therefore he is not a lightning bolt of war. However, the part of the process is excellent.</description>

Stupendous photograph by Gordon Willis for a bitter and compelling period story, but full of humor. Interpreters up to par, especially the couple formed by Jeff Bridges and Barry Brown.</notes>

		<description>The Milanese lawyer Marani returns home unexpectedly and glimpses the silhouette of a man hidden in the closet. Obsessed with jealousy, he thinks he is one of his wife's alleged lovers, locks him and goes on vacation with the woman. Back after about ten days, he discovers that it was the porter's son who had sneaked into the house to admire some hunting rifles. The professional is forced to call the police to free the young man who managed to miraculously survive. The film, almost an updated replica of the "Magnifico cucuto", focuses on nudity and half-nakedness. The star was an Edwige Fenech, as usual inexpressive, but very sensual.</description>

		<description>Tuscosa sheriff, McCabe, goes to the Comanche chief, Quannah, to negotiate the return of some white prisoners who have lived among the Indians for many years. He is joined by the young and impetuous Lieutenant Gary. After patient research, McCabe brings the survivors back to Fort Grant; then returns to Tuscos. The confrontation between the so-called white civilization and Indian culture turns into the passionate denunciation of the hypocrisy that governs the point of view of the former: a theme present in "Sentieri selvaggi" (1956), which will become central in "The great path" ( 1964).</description>

Having met at the court of the king of Naples, the two fall madly in love and meet again first in Switzerland and then in Bergamo. But everything gets complicated because the woman is married to an Austrian field marshal, who naturally does not like the affair.</description>
		<notes>Rich costumes, accurate sets, echoes of famous arias in the soundtrack, a careful direction by Camillo Mastrocinque. The pieces are all in place but something is not working. Perhaps the rhythm, which seems embalmed like Nazzari in the role of the composer.</notes>

		<description>Agilulf runs from Scotland to Morocco in search of Sofronia, the noblewoman who, alone, can prove to the world that he is a true knight, with a regular investiture. The doubts for the truth are well founded: Agilulf has an armor, a voice, but no body. Fun by the designer Pino Zac, based on a famous novel by Italo Calvino, mixing animation and real life actors.</description>

		<description>Casanova's brother is unjustly accused of having stolen some documents, actually stolen by spies in the service of Catherine of Russia. Giacomo Casanova therefore sets out on their trail and overcomes various obstacles thanks to his skill with the sword and the fascination he has on women. After a thousand adventures he finally manages to recover the documents and exonerate his brother. First leading role for Gassman. The sumptuous production is by Lux Film which entrusts the direction to Riccardo Freda, master of the fantastic and adventure film. Very fast pace, beautiful atmospheres and great success with the public.</description>

		<description>A preacher arrives in a country in the mountains where a mine owner would like to drive out independent gold diggers. Instead of using the words of the Bible against usurpers, the nameless stranger turns to Colt's lead.</description>
		<notes>If the "lonely valley" of the legendary "knight" by Alan Ladd and George Stevens was a metaphor for the lost and found Eden, the golden mountains of this Eastwoodian variation are only mud and blood. The setting, the characters and the action sequences, however, have an almost fantastic air. In a small role Chris Penn.</notes>

		<description>At the end of the Civil War, the stray brothers Frank and Jesse James, Bob, Cole and Jim Younger and Ed and Clell Miller, reunite in a gang. They storm Gallatin's bank, but the cashier is killed in the robbery and Jesse James is injured. Pinkerton's detective Rixley sets out on their trail, and his men turn out to be more brutal than the gang by killing even a child.</description>
		<notes>With the western dead, we begin to revisit the myth. Hill fits in perfectly, with the notes of a sad ballad and a handful of real brother actors (the Carradine, the Keach, the Quaid and the Guest). Romantic and tough, one of Hill's best movies. Music by Ry Cooder.</notes>

		<description>In the North-West territory, the Indian populations want to wage war on the white garrisons. The soldiers of the Seventh Cavalleggeri in a border fort are on alert. The elderly captain Brittles commands them, who tries to avoid bloodshed until the end: when he has to face a group of irreducible Indians, with a coup he will be able to deprive them of their horses thus making their attacks impossible. Second film in John Ford's so-called "military trilogy": not a militarist film but a poetic reinterpretation of the myths of the frontier, with its landscapes, hymns, virile friendships. Great Wayne, self-deprecating when he is presbyopic, is moved and converses with his dead wife in a sublime scene. Oscar for color photography by Winton C. Hoch, inspired by the life paintings of the Remington frontier.</description>

Recommended by Merlin, Lancelot marries and leaves the court. A civil war caused by Mordred breaks out. Lancelot returns in time to rescue the dying Arthur and kill the evil Mordred.</description>
		<notes>MGM's first cinemascope film, it is a work in which you find everything you would expect from a film of this genre: long duels, spectacular battles, parties and sumptuous costumes. In short, a romantic Hollywood version of the myth of Arthur.</notes>

		<description>We are in 1965, in an American town. In the local high school the usual band of unleashed elements has formed, which have their usual point of reference in a drive-in. But this is about to be closed and of course it doesn't go down to our heroes. The recurrence of Halloween arrives and the group decides to take action; the film follows their exploits during the fateful night. A bad and goliardic American Graffiti. The intentions are to play on the bizarre and the grotesque, but the humor that derives from it is rather from young students of little imagination. The only curiosity: the presence of an almost novice Michelle Pfeiffer next to the "nanny" Fran Desher.</description>

		<description>We are in 1832. The young Marquis Ottavio embarks on a journey through Italy in the company of his friend Paolo. The two friends end up with an old prince. Love and intrigue follow one another. Paolo is killed and after him the stable boy Alfonso, of Jacobin ideas. The Bourbons restore order. As in a fairy tale, Ottavio sets off with his two dead friends towards the city of Philadelphia.</description>
		<notes>Sergio Staino's film debut. Beautiful nineteenth-century setting for an allegorical tale, in which satire and fantastic spirit go hand in hand. The narration is a bit fragmented, interrupted here and there by abrupt passages or by too verbose delays.</notes>

		<description>Celestina's PR service is nothing more than the cover of an unedifying "traffic": procuring girls available to wealthy gentlemen. When the scandal breaks out, the mature pimp exploits her friendships in the high ground. Biting portrait of the "Milan to drink" in the boom years, vaguely inspired by the classic "Celestina" by Rojas. Assia Noris amazed everyone by returning to the screens after an absence of almost twenty years.</description>

		<description>The rivalry between Giannetto Malespini and Neri Chiaramontesi is long-standing. Giannetto manages to have Neri imprisoned on charges of being mad and hastens to steal his lover, Ginevra. Neri manages to escape, runs to Ginevra's house well-intentioned to take revenge and kills the man who is with her, who is her brother, led there by the cunning of Giannetto. At that point Neri really goes crazy.</description>
		<notes>Famous transposition from the play by Sem Benelli, in which, however, the most famous things remain Nazzari's joke: "Who does not drink with me, plague catch him" and a nude scene with Clara Calamai who, although fleeting, at the time caused a sensation.</notes>

Cinderella is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters who are angered by her purity and beauty. Thanks to a magical intervention she can participate in a court ball where the prince falls in love with her.</description>
		<notes>Shot in the Icet studios in Turin, with real interiors at the Royal Palace of Turin and exteriors of the castles of Stupinigi, Tolcinasco and the Royal Palace of Monza, the film is of its kind very dignified, even if it can appear a bit static. Second direction by Fernando Cerchio, who will dedicate himself with some results to "mass consumption" cinema.</notes>

She finds these requirements in Jo, a bookstore clerk, takes her to Paris, educates her, makes her a sophisticated woman. Jo for her part is thrilled because she will finally be able to meet the famous French philosopher Bartre. While the philosopher turns out to be a bluff, the magazine's photographer falls in love with the girl. An irresistible musical. Audrey Hepburn in Paris only dresses Givenchy, but she would also be enchanted in rags.</description>

But they soon reveal their true intentions: to conquer the village. Only after a bloody battle will Christians defeat the infidels.</description>
		<notes>Shot with great means and with a skilful hand, following the Brechtian canons of distancing from events, this film is a real apologue against the war. There are many ironic ideas and apt characterizations. Despite this, the film at the time proved to be bankrupt, closing the doors of the cinema in Cottafavi for years.</notes>

He will be able to reverse the situation but none of the cavemen will return with him to the surface world. Based on a novel by Edgar Borroughs (the author of Tarzan), produced by a British company specializing in fantastic films, it is a fun adventure film with Peter Cushing who is almost a caricature of his most famous character, Baron Frankenstein.</description>

		<description>To overcome boredom, Roberta follows Jim and Susan's loves through the messages they send each other through newspaper ads. Curious, she goes on the trail of Susan, but this leads her to be involved in a series of bizarre and increasingly risky adventures, since at a certain point the dead also escapes. Moreover, a blow to the head causes her to lose her memory: when she wakes up she thinks she is Susan. Everything will be resolved in a night meeting, with a final whirlwind of disguises, couples and awards.</description>
		<notes>Great success of this film, thanks to an impeccable direction and the sparkling couple Rosanna Arquette / Madonna.</notes>

		<description>The only witness to the murder of a policeman, Sister Agostina helps Inspector Goddard (Ladd) to trace one of the murderers, but his boss, fearing that he may speak, has him killed before he can be arrested.

		<description>Marta and Nanda are two women linked by a long friendship, but with completely opposite characters: one is a dreamer and romantic, the other calculator and careerist. Both have long been looking for the prince charming, or a good husband. Nanda finds it, in the role of a young and kind interior designer and immediately Marta works to steal it from him, but both face a disappointment. In fact, the young man is in his turn in love with ... a bearded Viking.</description>
		<notes>A vaguely risque comedy for the time taken from a text by Dacia Maraini, which plays on the key of ambiguity with light intentions, but with many lapses of taste. Of course the two protagonists are not to be thrown away ...</notes>

Before leaving, however, Harry, who is not naive, decides to X-ray the container and realizes that it contains some cultures of deadly bacilli. Thus he discovers that he has ended up in a plot hatched by a mysterious American organization ...</description>
		<notes>The secret agent Palmer, after _Ipcress_ and _Funerale in Berlin_, continues to distance himself with class from his colleague Bond. Sumptuous direction by Russell, Malden's “bad guy” excellent; last film for the splendid Dorléac, in the life of the sister of Catherine Deneuve, who died in 1967 at the age of 25.</notes>

		<description>The film tells the story of the life, loves, debut in the world of fashion and the worldwide success of Coco Chanel, who established herself as the undisputed queen of fashion in the first half of the century. The story starts from her beginnings as a stubborn girl, committed to replacing all the frills of the time with a dry, rigorous, new and practical style. The personal component of Coco is not lacking, especially her loves, now tender now stormy, always however rather unfortunate.</description>
		<notes>Halfway between the informative documentary and the gossip report, the film presents a complete picture of this figure who has now entered Olympus.</notes>

Charley, who is a demanding and brusque man with his family, begins to change attitudes and character. If it were the first angel to descend on a film set, perhaps the story would stand. The problem is that this Disney story, with some variations, we have already seen in various versions, often better.</description>

After a thousand ups and downs he manages to make Carface pay for it, finds the parents of a little orphan and then returns happy to the paradise of dogs.</description>

		<description>A company of guitti, headed by the manager Guido Guidi, is hired for a tour in Mexico. Here Guidi becomes a friend of a prelate and the two soon find themselves involved in one of the very frequent putsch that upset the life of the town. Tossed between a revolutionary captain and a federal colonel, the two escaped several times for the broken cap at the shooting. The experience, however, leads the two to reflect on the meanings of the struggle against the oppressors. Now grotesque, now delicate, the film benefits from the interpretations of Vittorio Gassman (the boy) and Paolo Villaggio (the priest).</description>

Through the narrative pretext of the character of Brett Sinclair, an English baronet friend of detective Danny Wilder, here are two episodes of the television series Beware of those two packaged for use on the big screen, with Tony Curtis and Roger Moore investigators "sui generis". In the first, an international thief is neutralized with the help of a girl. Also in the second the decisive intervention of some women takes the two friends out of big trouble.</description>

		<description>Baby Jane is a child prodigy who performs on theaters and variety stages. But the success makes her become spoiled and a bully against her sister Blanche. The parts are reversed when, as an adult, it is Blanche who succeeds as a movie star, while Jane is forgotten. An accident interrupts Blanche's career, forcing the sisters into a forced coexistence full of regrets, hatred and bitterness. Excellent interpretation of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, directed by a great director, Robert Aldrich, in a bloody BDSM duel between female characters.</description>

He tries to get rid of it, but mistakes it for that of two beautiful hitchhikers; then he tracks down the two girls in a house that is at the center of a drug trade. A marijuana salad is fatal for Totò: the drug makes him a sadistic murderer with the tic of walling up his victims alive.</description>
		<notes>Parody of the thriller with Bette Davis "What happened to Baby Jane?". The plot, as often happens, is ramshackle but Totò is unparalleled in his comic vis. The drug-based lunch is memorable, with the sadistic grin appearing on the face of the unsuspecting Totò.</notes>

		<description>Rome, early 1920s; the young Ulysses (Delon), enrolls in the Fasci di combat, but, having come into contact with a family of anarchists which includes the beautiful Franca (Lass), he finds himself having to pretend he too is a member of the movement. When the opportunity arises to carry out attacks, Ulysses does not feel like provoking innocent victims. The tone of the film is that of an ironic historical reinterpretation and the comedy is conducted with remarkable class. French director René Clément (Forbidden Games) has an elegant narrative style, linked to the forms of classic cinema; excellent actors.</description>

		<description>Chewingum is the name of a bar, located right in front of the Colosseum, where a group of eighteen-year-olds close to the final exams meet. There is the girl with the lovers who arrive in Maserati, there is the steady couple, the playboy, the ugly girl, there is the one who quotes Buñuel to conquer the alternate in philosophy. Between scenes of jealousy and jokes, we finally arrive at the day of the exam.</description>
		<notes>A film that would like to fit into the youth trend and that does not even reach the level of the Vanzina. In the cast, alongside completely negligible actors, there are also Marina Occhiena, the blonde of the "Ricchi e Poveri" and the star of the photo novels Massimo Ciavarro.</notes>

		<description>With a semi-alcoholic husband and ten dependent children, Lucille (Ann-Margret) learns from a radiologist that she has cancer. Her husband, who loves her very much, but who works occasionally due to arthritis and is also an alcoholic, causes a lot of problems for the woman. Given the situation Lucille starts looking for adoptive parents who can welcome her children.</description>
		<notes>The story is true and it's not nice to be ironic. But was it really necessary to make a film of it? With this not-so-happy story Ann-Margret makes her unmemorable television debut, but we could easily have done without it.</notes>

		<description>Harry Crumb is an investigator from the "Crumb &amp; Crumb" agency, so bungling that he is transferred to Tulsa, where nothing happens. One day he is unexpectedly commissioned by his boss to investigate a kidnapping case, relying precisely on the fact that Harry's poor professional skills will not allow him to figure it out. Harry will solve the case brilliantly instead.</description>
		<notes>The qualities of captivating sympathy of the good actor John Candy (unfortunately died prematurely) are now known and appreciated by all; the film exploits them quite well, even if some gags are obvious.</notes>

		<description>A New York composer, Georgie Soloway, is haunted by a menacing character for no apparent reason. Having achieved success in the field of rock music, after leaving the conservatory, Georgie has climbed all the heights of success. On the contrary, his private life was a ruin. In the paranoid contrast his personality splits into Kellerman's character: his own torturer. Paranoid thriller beautifully starring Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Harris. The directorial game of continuous passage from reality to fantasy is interesting, which makes the film a beautiful apologue on the neurosis of contemporary man.</description>

		<description>A child, mother and grandmother. The child has mediumistic faculties and is able to evoke the presence of his brother who died in a well. The film is all suspended between supernatural and madness, in a game that reflects the tradition of "Psyco" and its surroundings, but also exploits the left side of childhood. A highly evocative horror, terrifying without special effects, it is perhaps the best Mulligan film and one of the best horror films of the 70s.</description>

When everything is ready, Maria learns that her sister Lisetta, seduced by a noble idler, is expecting a child. At the birth of the child, it happens that Maria is accused of having abandoned the newborn and imprisoned. Only twelve years later Stefano learns the truth and tries to reconcile with Mary.</description>
		<notes>Fifth melodrama in three years, "Who is without sin ...", probably suffers from a certain tiredness that Matarazzo was beginning to feel towards a genre that had now caged him.</notes>

They will come out, in pieces, after causing the clash between the other two as well. But somehow hatred will make them even more accomplices and neighbors. Mike Nichols' first film. The theatrical origin (the film is based on a successful work by Edward Albee) is not hidden, but rather underlined by the claustrophobic setting and by the unity of time (one night only) in which the story takes place, classically. Nichols himself, moreover, came directly from theatrical direction. Of course, Burton and Taylor are the star performers, even too much. Three Oscars: Liz Taylor (protagonist), Sandy Dennis (supporting), Haskell Wexler (photography).</description>

With only one clause: he will have to squander thirty of them within a month. With the further warning that it will not be able to buy houses, land or other durable goods. Nor will he be able to reveal to anyone the reasons for this sudden mania for squandering.</description>

		<description>An attractive art critic, witness to a murder, is protected by the police. The evening surveillance shift is entrusted to the young inspector Mike Keegan, a family man who is going through a difficult time with his wife. Soon a crazy passion arises between the two, but the killer thinks about involving Gregory's family in a final showdown that will return the man to his role and his place. After the failure of the previous "Legend", Ridley Scott relies on the solid foundation of a classic thriller plot, even if the main weaknesses of the film nestle in the development of the story.</description>

		<description>Ernie Souchak is an assault reporter for a Chicago newspaper. As good as he is a nuisance, he is sent as punishment by his director to interview an ornithologist who lives in complete solitude in the Rocky Mountains. In fact, the woman is studying a rare species of eagle. The wolf, however, loses his fur but not the vice and with his impetuousness the journalist disrupts the quiet of the scholar, but wins her heart. At the beginning it is an open battle, but the opposites attract more and more until the final marriage with a bunch of eagles. In truth, so cleansed and "normalized", John Belushi could no longer be compared to the overwhelming interpreter of Animal House or the Blues Brothers.</description>

It is the beginning of the end because he finds himself in the midst of an intrigue of murders and criminal gangs.</description>
		<notes>The plot is very dull and the actors do everything to not burst out laughing. Likewise many situations are incomprehensible even behind the stage fiction. In a minor role is Steve Buscemi who has not yet moved on to directing.</notes>

But each of his identities creates trouble for him: like Thomas, he is wanted by the police who believe him missing, as well as by some bad guys; like Noon is even accused of murder. As if that weren't enough, our hero has completely lost his memory. Western-spaghetti based on a novel by the prolific Louis Lamour, shot in Spain with American staff. The "yellow" vein of the story and an unusual care of the figurative aspect contribute to making it less obvious than others.</description>

		<notes>A good result, subtle and significant even under the graceful aspect of a young director of Italian cinema. Especially good is Margherita Buy in the role of Elena.</notes>

		<description>In the Middle Ages a group of knights chase a witch and live the walls in a pit together with some plague victims. The action changes and passes to the present day, with the young restorer Lisa working on a painting in a gothic cathedral. The work is marred by strange episodes, and a tragic fate falls to the librarian Evald whom Lisa falls in love with. The secret lies in a large stone in the basement of the cathedral, the same as that of that distant massacre.</description>
		<notes>Soavi, after the remarkable "Deliria", makes a film as rambling as the latest exploits of his mentor, Dario Argento. Only the medieval prologue is saved.</notes>

		<description>To allow Gianni Morandi to perform in his repertoire, which was enormously successful at the time, and to act alongside Laura Efrikian, his wife, a thin plot was created that tells of the encounter of the singer Gianni Raimondi, during his military service with a South American billionaire. But when he stops, Gianni goes home to his wife Laura, and it's a bad time because of a song that hasn't been released ...</description>
		<notes>Before the obvious "happy ending", we touch on the drama. A very cheap film, even with obvious technical limitations due to the fact that films of this type were shot in a hurry only to exploit the singing success of the protagonist.</notes>

		<description>On Broadway, there are many queuing up for a ballet gig in the musical directed by Zach (Douglas). Among others, there is also Cassie, formerly a dancer, who also has to overcome the sentimental rancor of the director, her ex-boyfriend. A ruthless psychological and professional selection makes the taste of success sweeter for the eight chosen. Richard Attenborough (actor in Jurassic park), formerly the author of successful musicals in the United States, masterfully controls the spectacular choreography. With some redundancy, the homage to humanity and fatigue that remain in the shadows behind the lights of a stage is heartfelt and convincing.</description>

		<description>Arnie is a seventeen-year-old boy, shy, shy and full of complexes. One day he buys a car, an old wreck to which he dedicates himself with passion and which he refurbishes with love. The machine, which possesses a mysterious and diabolical soul, begins to surround Arnie with a possessive and all-encompassing love and ends up isolating him from his environment and old friends.</description>
		<notes>John Carpenter is measured against Stephen King and the result is this horror gem. The exclusivity of the relationship that is established between the car and the boy justifies any aberration. But in the end they will be punished like any cursed couple. After all, this is a melodrama.</notes>

		<description>In an English camp, in 1942, a group of American aviators organized the first aerial bombardments in broad daylight against German territory. But their commander, after having created a fighting unit out of nothing, restoring a forgotten self-love to everyone, collapses from tension. Excellent American war film with aerial combat scenes that do not remain ends in themselves: the director is especially interested in the physical and mental stress to which those responsible are subjected, and the confrontation between different morals in crisis. Director King had extensive aviation experience, Gregory Peck in the role of the officer with a nervous breakdown is perfect.</description>

		<description>Maria Goretti (Orsini) lives with her parents and five brothers in a cottage in the swampy and unhealthy area of ??Nettuno, where the Serenellis, father and son, also live. When his father died of malaria, the Goretti family was exposed to the bullying of the Serenellis, of whom the young Alessandro (Matteucci) had a morbid passion for Maria, still almost a child, until, exasperated by the intransigence with which the girl defended her virtue, Alexander kills her.</description>
		<notes>Augusto Genina paints a reliable picture of the life conditions of the characters and also finds the right measure for the drama that takes place there. Hagiographic, but dignified. Award for the best Italian film and the best direction at the 1949 Venice Film Festival.</notes>

		<notes>One of the last works of Buñuel's Mexican period, in which - completely distorting the famous novel by Emily Brontë which the director was interested in since the 1930s - the master exalts the irrepressible and aggressive impulsiveness of the typically surrealist "amour fou", in a film dominated by dark romanticism and desperate lyricism.</notes>

In the city there are no more opponents for him, and the Kid is already thinking about moving when Lancey arrives. This is an old fox, universally recognized as the Number One and he came to town just to challenge Cincinnati. Unleashed bets and unclean tinkering around the match. The Kid is not in the best psychological conditions, also due to a too complicated love life.</description>

		<description>The film recounts a day in the Soviet Union with the stylistic features of an expanded documentary. Vertov captures with his camera (the cineocchio) the real life of the streets in the Soviet metropolises, editing the various sequences thematically. The first and only one of a series that was supposed to be six, this film is a prelude to Vertov's masterpiece that will be The Man with the Camera. It demonstrates the autonomy and strength of the cinematographic image and editing.</description>

		<description>Commissioner Tanzi leaves the police in protest against superiors who disapprove of his unorthodox methods. In contravention of what he was "advised" (pretending to be dead and fleeing to Switzerland) he threw himself back into the fray, but his past pursued him. Luigi Maietto, in fact, ended up in jail because of him, is back free and wants to take revenge.</description>
		<notes>By cleverly playing on the rivalry between two gangs, Tanzi achieves unexpected results. Italian by-product with the usual Maurizio Merli in the usual role of commissioner. After the various "violent Naples" and the "armed Italy", Lenzi scrapes the bottom of the barrel. And it shows.</notes>

		<description>In the Swiss Alps, during the summer of 1932, a 50-year-old Scottish doctor, Douglas, spends his holidays with his niece Kate, who is in love with him. A delicate and badly experienced situation by the girl, who confides in a young mountain guide, Johann; the latter, during an excursion, tries to persuade Douglas to give up on Kate. On the way back Johann falls and dies.</description>
		<notes>A harrowing "testament" by Fred Zinnemann ("High Noon"), the Austrian director who was inspired by autobiographical events. The mountain stands eternally on the corruptible lives of men, but in contrast, love seems even more powerful. Wonderful photograph by Peppino Rotunno.</notes>

		<description>Called to the Crusades before having succeeded in consummating the marriage, the noble Guerrando imposes a chastity belt on his wife Boccadoro. However, she is not willing to wait for him in the castle and so decides to follow him to the Holy Land. The journey and the search for the bridegroom are not immune from dangers for the woman who nevertheless finally reaches her goal: to have her hateful "garment" taken off. Not as trivial as the title and plot might suggest, it nevertheless falls into that historical genre - comedian who had a moment of popularity between the end of the sixties and the beginning of the seventies in the wake of the successful L'armata Brancaleone (1965).</description>

		<description>Vittorio meets Bianca. The two can't stand each other, they continue to quarrel and take offense: that's why they go to live together. The ménage is a disaster, until the two discover that by beating up their relationships improve. Thus they slip into a sado-maso tunnel that ends with an abortion for her and a trial for mistreatment for him. It was Francesca Archibugi who drew this unspeakable mess from a Moravian text. The same year Brigliadori should have presented the Zecchino d'oro, but its performances tied to the bed head put it in a bad light in the modest eyes of the organizers.</description>

A little _ Fried green tomatoes_ a little _ The chocolate factory_, the film starts at the tangent of nonsense, struggling to maintain consistency. Curiosity: Scales and Sachs were among the protagonists of _Fawlty Towers_, the hilarious TV series created by another Python, John Cleese.</notes>

		<description>Cesira and her daughter Rosetta, a young girl, after a bombing were displaced from Rome in the mountains of Lazio. When the allies break through the front, the two women are surprised by a patrol of Moroccans, who rape both of them. Thirty years later (and now with the right age) Loren reprises for TV the character with which she had an Oscar in the film directed by Vittorio De Sica in 1960, Palme d'Or at Cannes. The story is still that of Moravia's novel, but the outcome had been better three decades earlier, even if the protagonist puts all the determination at her disposal. More than Risi takes.</description>

When the danger seems to have been averted, the two women return to Rome; along the way some Moroccan soldiers rape them. De Sica, helped by the screenplay by Cesare Zavattini, translates Moravia's novel with sensitivity and vigor. The dominant character is that of Cesira, the mother, played with passion by a memorable Loren awarded with an Oscar and at the Cannes Film Festival.</description>

Love puts a hand in it: the little man, in fact, falls in love with the beautiful horsewoman.</description>
		<notes>In a time when he was the star of the tabloid tabloids, Chaplin puts his character in front of the symbolic audience of the "circus". A very modern film, the result of a maniacal work by the author-actor, with moments of high cinema and a perfect rhythm, which naturally sent Federico Fellini into raptures. The edition with the music composed by Chaplin in 1969 usually passes on TV.</notes>

While the police investigate, the maid and a dwarf following the noblewoman also die. Having escaped an attack himself, Wong solves the mystery. As inconsistent and agreeable as the whole "Mr. Wong" series (this is the third episode), with an incredible Chinese Boris Karloff.</description>

		<description>In 1870 South Africa was not yet fully colonized by the British. An adventurer, Parker, clashes with the evil Muller who has convinced the chieftain of a remote village to give him the concession for the exploitation of a mine. Parker, however, has the support of the English colonists and manages to get the better of his rival.</description>
		<notes>A colonialist film, almost a Union Jack commercial of imperialism. In the midst of so much desolation, a mermaid: Honor Blackman, very young and ready to become one of the most popular stars by the British in the 60s.</notes>

		<description>In 1765 in the village of Arkham, Joseph Curwen was burned at the stake, accused of human sacrifice. A century later one of his descendants, Ward, settles in Arkham with his wife. Under the influence of his ancestor, he comes to identify with him, despite the villagers' vain efforts to defeat Curwen's hold on Ward and his wife. Part of the Cormanian cycle dedicated to Poe, but actually also inspired by a Lovecraft novel, the film highlights a careful realization and a stylistic complexity that redeems the shortcomings of the screenplay. As usual, handsome Vincent Price.</description>

		<description>The story of Tommaso Campanella, philosopher and revolutionary of the seventeenth century, who described his utopia in The city of the sun and who in the name of that utopia even ended up before the Inquisition. It is the second feature by Gianni Amelio, shot for TV. Don't expect a romantic TV drama, rather a kind of philosophical documentary.</description>

		<description>After the Treaty of Paris, the city of Pula was annexed to Yugoslavia and almost all Italians abandon it. Among the few who choose to stay is Berto, who is promised that he will be the owner of the workshop where he is a worker. But these are the lies of the Communists, because the machinery is confiscated by the state and the work languishes. Berto rebels and is locked up in a concentration camp; manages to escape and tries to reach Italy with a boat, but is killed by the Yugoslavs. Anti-communist propaganda that fails to be convincing nor to move despite the screenplay being also signed by Fellini.</description>

		<notes>A cheap cartoon. Pani, Lino Troisi, Salerno, all actors of good reputation, lend themselves to this operation only for declaredly "food" purposes. And it shows. Luc Merenda, on the other hand, is perfectly in tune with the rest.</notes>

Danny, one of the gambling den associates, feels guilty about what happened. He investigates and discovers that the suicide's brother is a psychopath. He will manage to kill a player again, but then he will finally be captured. Solid character construction and direction. Overall a decent noir, even if not memorable.</description>

		<description>New York, immediately after the war. A girl was killed by two men, one of whom was then stunned by his accomplice and thrown into the Hudson River. The police begin their investigation and begin questioning the friends of the deceased. This is how in the end he discovers that the victim was also part of a gang of jewelry thieves and that therefore the murder was a settling of scores. Almost a documentary, a violent indictment of the contradictions of modern life in a metropolis. It is the closest thing to neorealism that Americans have ever done. Oscar for photography by William Daniels.</description>

They soon discover that the captain, the only survivor of the shipwreck, has provided false indications to calmly take possession of the treasure. The ship is on the seabed where there are the remains of a city that sank during a tsunami and for the natives the area is taboo. Another earthquake collapses the city and buries the treasure forever, but the two are saved. Entertaining film about manly friendship by Boetticher, a former bullfighter who then directed exemplary westerns such as The Seven Murderers.</description>

The whole area is contaminated and the bloody events begin to occur like wildfire. To control the situation, the army intervenes with dubious results. Only one man will be able to escape total destruction. Great idea and great film made at very low cost by Romero. It is the film that taught everyone to stay away from old ladies who make stockings.</description>

		<description>In Genoa, during a robbery in a post office, three bandits take one of the customers hostage, the engineer Carlo Antonelli. Beaten to death and abandoned in a car, Antonelli wants revenge but, when he realizes that the police will not help him much, he decides to go in search of the bandits and to take his own justice. To this end, he blackmails a young fool who then goes over to his side. Usual film of the vein "I'll make the law", but certainly not the worst of the series. Among the curiosities the presence, in the cast, of Barbara Bach, ex-girlfriend of James Bond and later wife of the "Beatle" Ringo Starr.</description>

With his four children, violent and crazy misfits, he gives life to a gang that sows terror with machine gun shots. Darkly ironic towards the American society of the thirties, the film - truculent but told with a dry and lean style - is one of the best proofs of Roger Corman.</description>

		<description>A journalist who wants to make a film about Claretta Petacci's life comes up against the scarcity of the material available. He then decides to contact the sister of Mussolini's unfortunate lover, Miriam, to acquire information. Thus he discovers, beyond the conventional image, a woman who, if at first she had been fascinated by the myth of the Duce, had then been able to share his tragic end simply pushed by love. Another "provocation" by Squitieri, here in search of a different point of view on the characters of the fascist twilight. Nancy Brilli, a rampant interpreter of the most recent Italian cinema, makes her debut by chance.</description>

		<description>A Toronto lawyer is involved in the lawsuit in favor of the Indians and against the logging multinationals. But his attempt to resolve the differences with the dialectic leads to nothing. After losing the most important cause, he gets involved by a terrorist Indian in the kidnapping of an executive of one of the lumber companies. A long night and a long discussion about the need for violence and the trees that are inhabited by the gods ends with a crucial decision for the lawyer: to abandon the profession and take up arms. The references to Dances with Wolves are not few and the presence of Graham Greene (nominated for an Oscar for Costner's film) confirms the impression. The result, however, is much more confusing.</description>

		<description>Caesar, having landed in Egypt after defeating Pompey, falls in love with Cleopatra and organizes her triumph through the streets of Rome. When he is killed by the conspirators, the queen of Egypt sides with Marcus Anthony, who in turn has fallen prey to his charm, against Octavian. The latter, however, prevails in battle. Antonio commits suicide and Cleopatra, to escape the winner, also chooses to die.</description>
		<notes>American Kolossal shot in Italy without sparing means (it took more than a month to organize the extras the master of arms Enzo Musumeci Greco). Mankiewicz, who took over from Rouben Mamoulian, tries not to be overwhelmed by the project's elephantiasis. He grossed a lot, but not enough, and Fox went bankrupt. On the set, the love between Burton and Taylor blossomed and filled the pages of pink magazines.</notes>

Their goal is to free the "missing in action", that is all those fellow soldiers taken prisoner by the Vietcong and never let go again.</description>
		<notes>Chuck Norris-style action movie that winks at Stallone's latest forced hit ("Cobra") in the title. Ludman - that is to say Fabrizio De Angelis - is a bit of a beggar of the US genres but in this case one cannot fail to recognize a certain effectiveness. However only for aficionados.</notes>

		<description>At the end of the first "Cocoon" some old folks were suddenly thrilled by the beneficial flow of enormous life-bearing alien "cocoons". Having established, after the initial misunderstandings, a positive relationship with the extraterrestrials, the old men had decided to move en masse to their planet to avoid the problems of old age. Up there they are fine now (they have become practically immortal) but, deep down, they feel homesick and homesick. They then decide to return to Earth for a happy reunion. And, of course, they amaze everyone here with their extraordinary manifestations of vitality, before returning to space.</description>

		<description>In occupied France in 1944, the seventeen-year-old farmer Lucien attempts to enter the "maquis" (as the French have called their Resistance movement). Not having been accepted, almost out of spite, the boy becomes a collaborator and is drafted into the police. He will try, for love, a belated ransom One of the great films of Louis Malle, with an excellent psychological excavation and a very happy rendering of the environmental context. The protagonist is the dramatic portrait of an immature, unable to distinguish between Good and Evil, whose choices are not dictated by ideology or politics but by an instinct of rebellion and chance. Towards him, the director shows a touching human compassion.</description>

He, a writer in need of lack of inspiration, is supported by a mature wealthy lady. Between various incidents, the two begin a game of bitter reflections that induces them to start a new life.</description>
		<notes>The film, based on a beautiful screenplay by George Axelrod which adapted a novel by Truman Capote, benefits from Hepburn's graceful interpretation. He had two Oscars, for the soundtrack and the song "Moon River" by Henry Mancini. Suspended between sentimental comedy and slapstick ignitions, he established Blake Edwards as director.</notes>

		<description>A hippie, a coarse blonde, and a scruffy bandit come into possession of a heap of emeralds. They hide it on a horse they own and cross the border that divides Mexico from the United States. Here they try to cheat each other to get hold of the loot, but arousing the suspicions of a sheriff who begins to investigate them and discovers the whole truth, bringing them to justice after many twists and turns. Despite the presence of Carradine and Waits, this parody of the twilight western a la Peckinpah, is without inspiration and does not come out of stereotypes.</description>

		<description>The film tells the adventures of a young boy from the Middle Ages who, on the trail of his beauty, kidnapped by a squire, does not disdain the favors of various maidens and ladies. There is no real story, just a parade of trivia and beauties in historical clothing. The only peculiarity of the film is that it was the last film starring Brigitte Bardot.</description>

		<description>Arianna (Federica Moro) goes to college piloting her helicopter, Marco (Christian Vadim) is around the skies as a cadet of the military academy: the two meet and it is love at the first whirlwind of blades. Assorted jokes, singing, dancing, synchronized swimming, skydiving and majorettes. A few small disagreements, but then the fateful "yes" of the wedding.</description>
		<notes>The Eighties were deadly for Italian cinema, but Castellano &amp; Pipolo had been doing damage long before so the unfortunate decade was their golden age. Here they involve in nothingness a former Miss Italy and the son of that Roger Vadim who discovered and married Brigitte Bardot.</notes>

		<description>Lieutenant Jeff Knight is fresh out of the academy. From West Point it is shipped directly to Truong Lam Village, Vietnam. We are in 1970 and Jeff is convinced that he is facing a chore. His platoon of eighteen men is made up of boys all in their twenties, all with a war experience superior to his. Jeff will quickly understand that this is a dirty war. It's a bad copy of Platoon. Dudikoff has the same expression as when he did American Ninja, the director is the brother of Chuck Norris.</description>

		<description>Colonel Buttiglione begins this new chapter of his and his subordinates' (mis) adventures in the worst possible way: it even blows up, shattering into a thousand pieces. Reassembled thanks to a prodigious surgery, he can continue to be the protagonist and spectator of the idiotic "feats" of a straitjacket army. But it seems that the less than commendable series should end here. The first film appearance of the character was already worth little, and the quality certainly did not improve one film after the other, with the consistency of a farce aimed at the public of more modest pretensions. No regrets.</description>

		<description>Shot down in his plane, Colonel Ryan is taken prisoner and locked up in a concentration camp. The camp is in pitiful condition, both because of the fascist major and the obstruction of a British major. Ryan initiates forms of collaboration that however earned him the derogatory nickname of Von Ryan. Upon liberation, the prisoners end up in the hands of the Germans, but Ryan arranges a daring escape.</description>
		<notes>War movie assembled with the classic clichés of the genre. Raffaella Carrà makes a tiny, undressed part, which was much publicized at the time.</notes>

		<description>Eddie Felson has long since hung up the cue, but his clinical eye is left and one evening, around a pool table, he sees in action a boy who could revive his glory. The young man, however, is rough and Eddie improvises himself as a master, not only in the art of putting marbles in the hole, but also in the more difficult art of being in the world and making money with his own skill. The two, also helped by the young man's girlfriend, set up a good business by going from table to table and poaching wealthy chickens.</description>
		<notes>Scorsese directs a film not "his" with the highest skill and some virtuosic shots in the billiard scene. The interpretation of Newman (who finally won the Oscar with this film) is very classy, ??but Cruise and Mastrantonio manage to keep up with him. Screenplay by Richard Price from a novel by Walter Tevis.</notes>

		<description>We are in 1934. Italy participates in the final phase of the soccer world championships. The Duce wants us to win "at all costs"; the task of preparing the implementation of this imperative falls to Commissioner Vittorio Pozzo. After the final victory over Czechoslovakia he will be carried in triumph by his Azzurri. A sporting exploit dear to the memories of the fans: De Sisti avoids the trap of competitive reconstruction and fixes attention on the human and political implications of the event. In the cast some important names of the new generation of Italian performers.</description>

		<description>In 1920s Georgia still dominated by a slave and racist mentality, Celie (Goldberg), just a teenager, is raped by the man she was given as a companion. Subsequently, the children born from the relationship are taken away and she is sold to another man. The latter, even more brutal than the first, also begins to undermine Nettie, Celie's younger sister, who rejects him decisively. After Nettie was thrown out of her home following her "rebellion", poor Celie had no choice but to bow to the life of a slave. Only many years later will he be able to embrace his sister and children in a meadow of purple flowers.</description>
		<notes>Accused by critics of making films for twelve-year-olds, Spielberg attempts the "adult" film card. The result is a mess, where the sacrosanct anti-racist claims are watered down in good feelings.</notes>

Bob, older, tries to make impulsive Denny understand the importance of calm and tolerance in a delicate job like theirs.</description>
		<notes>At the time, the film caused a sensation due to the rawness of the language and situations. But the best thing is Hopper's attempt to combine documentary aggression with the strength of fiction. The result is remarkable, also thanks to the two protagonists.</notes>

When a woman is attacked at night, he will be charged. All the elements suggest a conviction, but the friend in charge of defending him dismantles all the clues and demonstrates that the real culprit is a highly decorated officer whose madness is kept hidden for reasons of image. The regimental commander was also complicit. A judicial thriller in an unusual setting, well performed by some of the best English actors.</description>

		<description>A mediocre mystery writer receives a strange assignment: he has to write the biography of a famous and dangerous gangster, based on the notes he himself provided. All the people who contacted him are, however, mysteriously murdered. The explanation originates in an event that took place many years ago and someone is interested in not talking about it anymore. Suspended between comedy and action thriller, the film is a successful parody of the most popular fiction (the original title, Pulp, alludes to cheap detective novels). Everything is based on Michael Caine, as usual cheerful and light-hearted.</description>

		<description>Clarkles Olson, a well-known jeweler, hires two convicts to carry out a daring theft in Israel: together with them he must violate the complex security system that protects the Diamond Center, designed by Olson's brother. Despite many setbacks the plan succeeds, but Olson does not steal anything: his real purpose was only to inflict a humiliation on his brother, too full of himself. He walks away amid the angry helplessness of the policemen, after having paid lavishly the accomplices of the non-theft. Menahem Golan, a producer of mixed fortunes, has also directed some comedies and some action films, without ever excelling.</description>

Planted by the girl and fired for his marked propensity to make trouble, he is invited to Venice by a friend who works as a hotel porter. Hosted in his house, he falls in love with none other than his 11-year-old daughter. Moreover, it happens that the girl takes a crush on him ... Marco Risi in his period "Calà", which began with his debut in 1982, I go to live alone. The idea is not evil, but it would have taken much more sensitivity to play it with the necessary lightness.

		<description>Baltic countries, 1919. The Bolsheviks are about to take power and the German expeditionary force is now on its way. Erich is a young army officer, he is handsome and homosexual, but he is seduced by a countess. For the woman this love is only a pastime to make the now certain death less cruel. It will be the same officer to hear the countess, killing her when the revolution has already triumphed. Shot in the same landscapes where Schlöndorff's most famous film, Torless, had been shot ten years earlier, it was written and starred by Margarethe von Trotta, the director's wife at the time.</description>

It's all a misunderstanding, but Andrea challenges his rival to a duel: he could kill him, but he decides to do it later. Only after many years the deception is finally revealed and the love between the two can triumph.</description>
		<notes>Castellani's debut film, scripted by Mario Soldati. Formally cared for, refined, exemplary.</notes>

		<description>Robin Weathers (Nelson) is a rampant young lawyer. His histrionic talent is matched only by his contempt for the rules. In the past, he has built a reputation for solving a basket case in his favor. Now he has a great new opportunity before him: to defend a man accused of murder, one who is second to none in terms of contempt for humanity. Bob Clark had the misfortune of winning success with Porky's. Before he was just a mediocre, now he's a mediocre who can't forget he was at the top of the box office. John Hurt alone manages to save half of the film, but only half.</description>

		<description>Various humanity flocks to the Roman coast on Sundays to look for some quiet, some easy adventures: everyone will be mocked or disappointed. Among them, a young employee, who would like to live beyond his means, loses all his savings to poker; three beach parrots try to approach a group of pretty foreigners ... A mature professor is the victim of the joke of one of his former students, whom he rejected in the exams.</description>
		<notes>In short, the vices and defects of Italians in bathing suits. The idea could be interesting, too bad the film has neither a script nor a structure. Everything is resolved in a series of anecdotes, more or less spicy.</notes>

		<description>Charles, a veteran of the underworld (Gabin) recently released from prison, joins the novice Francis (Delon) to make a heist at the Cannes casino, which should finally guarantee him a golden retreat abroad. The plan is almost insane, but meticulous and executed to perfection. But when it comes to reaping the rewards, one unexpected ruins everything. This beautiful thriller, in which the control of the action is combined with excellent dialogue, sees the couple Gabin-Delon together for the first time, balanced with intelligence by the director Henri Verneuil (The clan of the Sicilians). From the anthology the final scene.</description>

		<description>A Chicago gangster, Don Cesare Celli, old and retired in Italy, is kidnapped. Don Cesare, however, convinces his kidnappers to join him in a formidable blow: rob a load of platinum on the Naples-Taranto train. The blow succeeds, but the cargo is lost at sea by the plane that is taking them to Morocco.</description>
		<notes>It is a comedy conducted with a rather grungy tone between farce and parody. Some reason for interest can be found in the characterizations of the characters played by a crowd of the most famous actors of Italian and overseas cinema.</notes>

		<description>United States, 1950s. A basketball coach, disqualified for his rather abusive ways towards his players, agrees to take care of a minor college team. Against everything and everyone, against arbitration injustices and against the initial distrust of the citizens of the village, he leads the team to victory in the regional championship. The coach also manages to restore confidence to a former alcoholic player.</description>
		<notes>The cast is mouth-watering, but the story is totally conventional and that's a real shame. Good interpretation of Dennis Hopper in the role of the ex player with alcohol problems.</notes>

		<description>André is a journalist, has a silent wife named Christine, a boat on the Masurian lakes and a weekend off. During the trip, the couple picks up a hitchhiker, a student who can't even swim. André invites the boy to go on a boat with them despite the fact that the hostility between the two is clear. The crisis erupts when André throws a knife that the student cared about into the water. In the fight that follows, the boy falls into the water. It is not the usual story of a triangle, it is a square: him, her, the other and the boat. Great debut of Roman Polanski with a boat almost as claustrophobic as the apartment on the third floor. A black and mocking tragedy, co-scripted and edited by Jerzy Skolimowski.</description>

		<description>In Jerusalem in 1942 Peter, an English officer is about to marry his fiancée Victoria. Sarah, her sister, is against it because, by marrying a "gentile", the girl will be disowned by the family which is strictly religious Jewish. Then comes David, a friend of Peter, Sarah falls in love with him and so his beliefs change too. Their love story will be long and troubled.</description>
		<notes>Despite appearances, there are no great passions in Mizrahi's film. The direction is flat and the performances of the actors are not particularly engaging. Tom Hanks also doesn't seem to believe too much in his character.</notes>

In charge of the scam is the meek Zappi (Village), who, however, cannot reach the Canary Islands, where the sinking must take place. He is in fact persecuted by a mischievous missionary (who travels Africa carrying a huge crucifix on his shoulders), by a group of false Bedouins and by real savages who capture and sodomize his colleague Bigazza (Banfi). Eventually the yacht sinks: Zappi and Bigazza find themselves on a raft in the middle of the ocean.</description>

You are even more involved in the fight against the "witch hunt".</description>

Overtaken by the young rampant agents of the agency and forced to see friends who commit suicide in frustration, he decides to go on the counterattack. First of all he kills his wife who berates him for his failures. Considering himself impregnable (he had already liquidated a bum in the subway by getting away with it) he meditates revenge even in the workplace ... Poison comedy on eighties-style yuppism. Michael Caine is right for these roles and once again he doesn't disappoint: cynical and sly enough. Besides the biting fun, however, the film does not work and even the direction is nothing special.</description>

Instead the wife is expecting a baby and the suspicion that it is the friend's gnaws at the husband.</description>
		<notes>Melodrama with a high dramatic rate directed by Douglas Sirk, master of heated situations, played on feelings and fatality. Someone said that this family drama has tones of Greek tragedy, others that here are the roots of "Dallas" and "Dinasty". However, it is the triumph of the Hollywood baroque style.</notes>

It is the odyssey of poor Leo Bianchetti (Macario) - always in uniform and always in danger, thrown from place to place, anti-hero forced to live through all the travails of a tormented decade - narrated in a comic key, but with its own substratum deeply human. The protagonist is the emblem of millions of anonymous people on which history builds its splendor. The film has some interesting script cues, but it's pretty patchy.</description>

Coarse and amusing parody of the 007 series. Among the performers, Franco Bonvicini, cartoonist known under the pseudonym of Bonvi and creator of "Sturmtruppen" among other things.</description>

		<description>In London the crown of St. Edward was stolen and Inspector Laurence, in charge of the investigation, convenes a press conference. He told reporters that the coup was scored by Argoman. The reality is very different and the inspector to solve the case calls into question a well-known criminologist Sir Reginald who puts him in contact with Regina Sullivan. Meanwhile, a photo of the precious crown is sent to Laurence by the elusive Queen of the world who asks in exchange for a diamond capable of refracting the sun's rays.</description>

Alarmed by the announcement of an expert report, the girl asks for help from what she believes to be a thief and who is actually a detective specializing in art fakes ...</description>
		<notes>Entertaining comedy in which the refined beauty of Audrey Hepburn shines. The game of misunderstandings and misunderstandings is anything but new, but the direction of Wyler is a guarantee, while the touch of transgression that characterizes the finale makes the film a gem.</notes>

		<description>Three girls, ambitious models who live in New York, are fighting to realize the great dream of their life: to marry as many rich people and thus ensure a fabulous future. To do this, they rent a very luxurious apartment and then start weaving their own plots. To marry a millionaire, however, you need the right stuff and, of the three, only two will be able, almost in spite of themselves, to prove that they have it.</description>
		<notes>Reworking of a comedy of twenty years earlier ("The Greeks Had a Word for Them" by Lowell Sherman) one of the best comedies of Jean Negulesco. Particularly adorable Marilyn in the airplane sequence, when she is forced to admit her vision defect and, in doing so, finds her boyfriend.</notes>

		<description>Jane, daughter of Lord Broadbent, joins her father in London. Stepmother Sheila wants the girl to participate in the debutante ball, but Jane is not interested in the possible escorts she is offered. His feelings are for David, a young American drummer who enjoys a reputation as a Don Juan. The surprise appearance of a noble title attributed to the young man solves everything. Vincente Minnelli, in the prime of his maturity as a filmmaker, enjoys combining the pieces of this sophisticated puzzle. An exercise in style, a comedy aimed with joy against the tics and paranoia of a nobility now outdated by the times.</description>

		<description>Two friends are unintentional witnesses to a robbery and are threatened with death by the killer involved in the crime. One of them intends to convince the killer to spare them; the other is instead determined to eliminate the criminal and therefore follows a survival course to become a sort of Rambo. In the final analysis, the common sense of the former triumphs, even if the latter does everything to arrive at the solution of force.</description>
		<notes>The duet of actors (Matthau is the calm type, Robin Williams the frantic) is the best thing about the film. In the grand finale the farce prevails over satire, even if the director wants to impeach the gunsmithing and aggressive mentality of some America.</notes>

Matrix accepts, takes the plane to Val Verde, but manages to escape taking Cindy, a black stewardess, with her.</description>
		<notes>Apart from the bucolic scenes between Schwarzy and the little girl, frankly embarrassing because they are a bit reminiscent of "Frankenstein", the film has a good pace. Lester was perhaps more original in his early low-budget films ("Gas Station", "Born 1984").</notes>

		<description>Second World War. The American major Darby (Garner) believes in the usefulness of training a corps of commandos, the raiders already successfully tested by the British. Having obtained volunteers, he prepares them and guides them on the Italian front. In Naples he meets Angelina, an orphan from a good family. On the fronts of love and war, battles are intertwined equally painful and difficult. The film, honeyed and of little interest, is signed by a Hollywood legend, that William Wellman who directed about eighty films from the early 1920s to 1958, including Public Enemy (1931) and Bastogne (1949). Garner, at the beginning in the cinema, was already a television star.</description>

		<notes>At first glance it looks like a film by Pier Paolo Pasolini shot under the pseudonym of Bernardo Bertolucci. Then it turns out that Pasolini is just the screenwriter. It is still a great debut. The "dry commare" of the title is Death, as Gioacchino Belli calls it in a sonnet.</notes>

		<description>In the autumn of 1920, during the civil war, the military commissioner Claudia Vavilova discovers she is pregnant and manages to find refuge with a Jewish family. During childbirth, in delirium, the woman relives the sufferings of the war and sees her man who died in battle again. Meanwhile, the war continues, the Red Army must retreat: Claudia leaves the child and returns to fight. Produced in '67, the film was never released probably due to references to the Jewish question. First work by Aleksandr Askoldov who was no longer allowed to shoot a single meter of film in the twenty-two years that followed. Askoldov still managed to take his revenge, when in 1988, once "thawed", the film went on to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival.</description>

It is a real baptism of fire for the poor commissioner because the wounding of the girl seems to involve more than one prominent figure among Christian Democrat politicians and high prelates. In all this Borghini tries to coordinate his men in action, and often in trouble, in various areas of Rome.</description>

The brisk methods of the latter collide with the more scientific ones of the new director of police, Tellier, and it works to the advantage of Gassot who piles up murder after murder. The situation seems so hopeless, but then the unexpected happens.</description>
		<notes>Gabin is now making a fool of himself; Fabio Testi is in his period of greatest physical shape; also appears a Gérard Depardieu little more than a rookie. Denys de la Patellière is a decent craftsman, but the film is routine. Even in the final "surprise".</notes>

		<description>A crime has been committed in the Vatican: Commissioner Lo Gatto (Banfi), in charge of the delicate investigations, does not stop in front of anyone and even goes so far as to question the pope and therefore is transferred by his superiors on the island of Favignana. Here one day an attractive tourist, Wilma, mysteriously disappears. The inspector's investigations are immediately triggered, but it turns out that the woman, rather than kidnapped, was a "guest" of the Prime Minister on a Navy ship.</description>
		<notes>Typical role for Banfi, in which he can give depth to his entire repertoire between cabaret and grotesque. But despite Risi's signature, the satire is weak, the rhythm bland and televised, the yellow plot inconsistent.</notes>

		<description>For the intransigent policeman Max (Piccoli) the capture of criminals has become a fixed idea. With the unwitting complicity of an old friend, now turned to theft, and the prostitute Lily (Schneider) he sets a trap for a gang of burglars. But the arrest of Lily, with whom he has fallen in love, triggers a tragic conflict in Max. Set in a provincial town, the film masterfully describes marginal figures and environments and constructs two strong and multifaceted characters, excellently played by a Piccoli who knows how to find the right rigidity and suggests Max's drift towards paranoia and by a memorable Romy Schneider .</description>

		<description>In a small town in northern Italy, apparently clean and dignified, Commissioner Pepe (Tognazzi) discovers a completely different reality, steeped in rot, in which many unsuspected people are involved. From above comes the invitation to neglect the excellent names. At which, the commissioner chooses another solution: either all or none.</description>
		<notes>The portrait of the small town is deliberately exasperated in a grotesque dimension, but the film is a bitter apologue about power. In the wake of the 1968 protest, a funny but also bitter film, to be remembered above all for the good performance of Tognazzi.</notes>

		<description>At the end of the last century, in a Turin textile industry, a serious accident sparked off the first workers' protests against inhuman working conditions. The protest turns into a harsh strike, led by Professor Sinigaglia, during which a worker dies. The workers return to the factory, defeated, but with a thread of hope. Bankruptcy at the box office, it remains Monicelli's masterpiece despite some pathetic excesses. Perhaps too ahead of its time, it was an interesting attempt to turn the Italian comedy towards social commitment and historical reconstruction. Screenplay by Monicelli, Age and Scarpelli (which got the nomination).</description>

		<description>Fifteen years after leaving high school, a group of former students of the same class find themselves together again. The opportunity is good to take stock of the past, with some positive voices, many regrets, some sensational failures. The class of course is very heterogeneous and really there is everything: from the politician old Republic, all riding and cars with a lot of driver, to the "divorce" who without nostalgia is willing to leave the rich house of her partner. In the company there is also the little professor all inhibitions and complexes. In reality it is the latter (Verdone) who has maintained its own coherence, despite many contradictions.</description>
		<notes>Among the less successful films of Verdone. The direction manages to maintain the rhythm of a "group" film. The set of performers are compact and well-matched to the right point. Too bad that the situations are a bit obvious and there are many lapses in taste.</notes>

		<description>The Compagnia della Teppa is a group halfway between the goliardic and the militant that was formed in Milan during the Napoleonic domination. The Gonfaloniere himself sees the group with favor partly out of intimate and secret conviction, partly because his son is the leader. Father and son, then, are also united by love for a young singer, even if she naturally prefers the young one. It is one of the 71 Italian films produced in 1941, the year of autarky, a period in which a lot was produced, but without going too far. D'Errico, former film critic of the regime, died the same year.</description>

		<description>Brescello, the village of don Camillo and Peppone, is twinned with a Russian citizen. A municipal delegation, led by the mayor, therefore goes to the homeland of royal socialism to perfect the twinning. To it, in disguise, the parish priest also joins, anxious to grasp the deleterious aspects of communist society.</description>
		<notes>The last of the five films shot by the Fernandel-Cervi duo in over ten years, based on the characters of Guareschi. The waning of the ideological clash in the Italy of the Boom forces scriptwriters and director to a sort of revision of the reasons for the dispute between the two protagonists. Comencini had to direct the film obtorto collo due to contractual obligations, and he always hated it.</notes>

		<description>Katie and Guys, who have been married for 16 years, take a long sailing trip. But the woman has a weight on her heart: some time before she allowed herself an extramarital affair and is still afflicted by it. The two spouses come across a damaged boat and decide to host the young couple who occupies it on board, despite some obscure points in the story of their misadventures. And it will be a tragic mistake. A classic situation: the closed environment (even if in the middle of the sea), a remote fault to be paid for, the evil that presents itself in disguise. The interpreters are more than decent, the rendering of the dramatic tension is skilful, a film not devoid of interest.</description>

		<description>Henryk Bergman, future father of director Ingmar, was a Swedish Protestant pastor. When he was still a theology student he falls in love with Anna, but their love is thwarted for various reasons by their respective parents. The two break up, reconcile, separate again and then come back together; in the background, the great social tensions that swept through Sweden in the first decades of the century. Strongly desired by Bergman, who signs the film as a screenwriter and entrusts the direction to Bille August who wins his second Palme d'Or at Cannes (and the one for the best attracts Pernilla Ostergren, who will become his wife in life). The subject is interesting, but the realization is affected and heavy, too similar to a television drama.</description>

		<description>He, she and the other. He, Andrea (Rich), is an accomplished architect, she, Francesca (Spaak), is a pretty wife, but a little too much of a child for her sophisticated husband's tastes, so she feels neglected. Out of spite Francesca makes herself a lover. When the husband notices it, he seems to accept it with irony, but then he starts the counterattack and eventually regains his rightful half. The story is obvious and certainly does not shine for originality. Pasquale Festa Campanile would like to make some criticism of costume, but this intention can be glimpsed just under a light game, of little consistency. Despite everything, the actors are good.</description>

The result is a massacre from which only little Conan is saved. Years pass and the little boy has become a giant with only one idea in mind: to find the man who killed his parents and consummate revenge. Directed by John Milius, co-written by Oliver Stone, played by Schwarzenegger, it's as spectacular and gross as comic book adventures. For productive commitment and quality of direction it is far superior to the numerous imitations.</description>

		<description>Gathered in the ancestral castle for the opening of the will, the relatives of a very rich English nobleman discover with regret how all the belongings of the deceased go to the young niece Barbara, who has been close to the relative in recent times. Four murders occur and, despite the intervention of a Scotland Yard inspector, it is the modest Sergeant Thorpe of the local police who solves the case.</description>
		<notes>Moderately engaging, with some humorous situations, it has a cast of various origins: the opera singer Anna Moffo and the theater-television actors Marisa Fabbri (great Ronconian interpreter) and Giacomo Rossi Stuart, Kim's father.</notes>

		<description>Concorde LB 820 crashes near the coast of the Antilles during the test trip. A journalist, who smells sabotage, decides to investigate, but all those he comes into contact with are murdered and he himself risks his life. A stewardess, the only survivor of the disaster, tries to help him solve the case.</description>
		<notes>The discreet film was shot by Ruggero Deodato in 1979 following the success of the American catastrophic series "Airport". Nobody, at the time, thought that reality could surpass fantasy. Aboard the Concorde, a cast of old stars.</notes>

		<description>Young judge Steven Hardin (Douglas) tries to do his duty well, but is troubled by the fact that he is often forced to let certain offenders free just because their defenders cling to legal quibbles. It happens to him with a killer of old ladies and then with two foul thugs who have kidnapped a child, used him to make pornographic films and then killed him. The crisis of the judge is also reflected in his family life and relations with his wife Emily (Gless) are affected. Eventually Steven succumbs to the lure of a senior colleague, Judge Caulfield (Holbrook), and joins a secret team of executioners who are tasked with punishing those criminals that justice acquits.</description>

		<description>The magistrate Traini (Nero) does not agree with the methods of Commissioner Bonavia (Balsam): he argues that against the mafia the law is not enough and we must face it outside the law. Bonavia voluntarily kills a Mafia leader and is in turn eliminated once he is imprisoned together with an important witness. Traini continues the investigation but immediately realizes that with the only weapons of the law he will not be able to crush the Cosa Nostra. Film of civil commitment, as was fashionable in the early seventies, signed by Damiani with dryness but without great originality.</description>

		<description>A singular killer is terrorizing the parish of Father Thomas Cusak. The maniac attacks only women and, after killing them, gives them extreme unction. Cusak thus turns into a detective and begins to suspect Father Simmons, but neither his superiors nor the police seem to believe him. After yet another murder, however, the truth comes out. Christopher Reeve's fate is strange: his handsome physique always puts his acting qualities in the background (which is not excellent). Having become famous as Superman, he did not find many other film roles and thus took refuge in these non-exciting TV productions.</description>

		<description>Some obsessed with "cinema truth" around Paris, filming everything and the opposite of everything. It is a film that has practically no interweaving, other than that of juxtaposing moments and situations of a "stolen" false truth and constructing a polite and playful mockery, with a vaguely surrealistic flavor, of targets that are, for example, Godard and Resnais, that is, the gurus of French cinema of the time. A large group of excellent actors lend themselves, with a lot of humor, to participate in the game, that is to be the protagonists of a polite satire that also concerns them.</description>

		<description>Marcello lives in remorse for having killed a taxi driver at the age of 13 who wanted to rape him. On his honeymoon, in 1937, he went to Paris to prepare for the murder of Professor Quadri, an anti-fascist exile who had been his teacher at the University. Despite the suspicions of Quadri's wife, who was also attracted to Giulia, Marcello's wife, the assassination was successful. On 25 July 1943, in the crowd celebrating the fall of fascism, Marcello meets the driver he thought he had killed ... Based on the novel by Moravia, an ambiguous and refined film about a fascism seen as "Mortal disease" of the bourgeoisie. Unhealthy and fascinating, Hollywood and complex, it yields to the charm of ghosts that evokes and traces an impressive fascist for sloth. Enormous success, Bertolucci launched on the international market.</description>

		<description>A body is found in the New England countryside: it is Jennifer's second husband, a local. Some villagers try to hide the dead in a thousand ways, but the sheriff begins to suspect. Only when death is found to be due to a heart attack is the body returned to the place where it was found. In the meantime, two couples have been able to form themselves in the hustle and bustle.</description>
		<notes>Hitchcok, reducing John Trevor Story's novel for the screen, focuses on the irony of the situation and once again gives us a small masterpiece. Of course we laugh through gritted teeth. Great debut for Shirley MacLaine.</notes>

		<description>Tsar Ivan, having retired to a convent, yields to the demands of his people and returns to reign. In Moscow he finds guards loyal to the throne, but also traitors: Eufrosina, his aunt, plots with the boyars and the metropolitan pope and organizes an attack. Ivan, learning of it, replaces himself with the son of Eufrosina, who thus becomes a victim of his own mother. Ivan remains more and more alone and tormented. It is the sequel to Ivan the Terrible, a sequel not liked by Stalin who would have liked to be reflected in a certain way in the tsar and which saw Ivan's absolutism questioned. However, the artistic result is not inferior to the first part of the fresco for its epic breath, the splendid figurative aspect and the suggestive use of Prokofiev's music.</description>

Shadowy princesses, noble and haughty "don", mellifluous and cunning bandits and even a sweet but intrepid girl are the protagonists of this very romantic political intrigue. A solution of which, needless to say, the good ones win.</description>

		<description>On the border between Argentina and Paraguay lives Dr. Eduardo Plarr who tries to track down his father who disappeared for political reasons. He meets the English honorary consul, Charlie Forthnum: he loves alcohol a little too much and a prostitute, once Eduardo's lover, whose company he still does not disdain. The consul is accidentally kidnapped by a group of guerrillas who were actually aiming at the US ambassador. Kidnappers and victim find themselves barricaded and besieged by the police. Eduardo, who has a friend among the guerrillas, is involved as a doctor.</description>
		<notes>Graham Greene is one of the greatest writers of this century. From one of his novels, John MacKenzie seeks the security behind Michael Caine's great craft and Richard Gere's appeal, but, in the long run, the assortment isn't one that works best.</notes>

		<description>John, who left as a volunteer at the front, finally returns home from the Great War. The surgeons who saved him made a new face on him. His wife, who thinks he is dead, has tricked him into getting married again. The child who goes around the house is his son, but he doesn't know it because he believes he was born from his mother's second marriage.</description>
		<notes>Orson Welles' beard and Claudette Colbert's eighteen dress changes fail to revive a not-so-exciting film. Among the actors there is also Natalie Wood, here at her debut. If you can't recognize her it's because she was only 6 years old at the time.</notes>

		<description>Crazy Joe Clark (Freeman) is one who amply deserves his nickname. Only a fool would take it into his head to tidy up a school like Paterson's Eastside High. Only to eliminate the violent and the drug dealers would require an army. Clark acts like a marine sergeant to the recruits and ultimately manages to win the boys' trust. The Crazy Joe Clark story is true and it's pretty mundane. But John Avildsen ("Rocky") is someone who knows the right tricks to make it more than enjoyable. And then you find a lead actor who is stunning.</description>

		<description>The Earl of Essex has defeated the Spanish fleet but Queen Elizabeth is not too friendly with him: the two love each other, but the Queen fears the ambition of the noble, handsome and enterprising. Subsequently he has to resort to him again when a rebellion breaks out in Ireland: Essex will manage to win it again this time despite the sabotage of the envious courtiers. Eventually Elizabeth recognizes his value publicly but then has him sentenced to death because she understood that in reality he aspires to the throne.</description>

The sincere love that binds him to Fernanda does not prevent him from falling in love with the Duchessina Elisa, who is engaged to the Marquis Lollo. This attitude only worsens his relations with the Marquis, so much so that the latter pushes him into a duel against a French nobleman. For this purpose he is truly appointed count. Having also reached wealth, he marries the commoner.</description>

As on many other occasions ("The policeman", "The doctor of the health insurance" and, after this, "Scalpel the white mafia" and "The monster") Zampa, with his accomplices Deaf and Manfredi, pretends to make a mockery of the vices of the Italians.</description>

So when a mysterious Mr. Smith offers him to fly a plane in a smuggling operation, he at first accepts, then gets scared, then gives up fear and takes flight. Then, unhappy, he repents again and reports everyone to the police, a rather cheap film version of an Irwin Shaw novel. The actors, chosen without too much sagacity, show that they do not believe much in the story they interpret.</description>

		<description>Two friends, owners of a night club, are sailing in dire straits. Fortunately, one of them has a filthy rich twin brother. To protect himself from other inconveniences, the "poor" takes the place of the "rich", but the thing is not without its drawbacks ... Jerry Lewis is the director of a tired parody mystery (in turn sequel to "Salt and pepper: super spies hippy "by Donner) that wasn't exactly a hit.</description>

		<description>What do a lost-time smuggler and a blonde whose personal ambitions are summed up in the unbridled desire for social affirmation have in common? Fate takes care of it, as usual, to make them cross and meet in the midst of a dangerous international intrigue: at stake is a large shipment of weapons intended to support the anti-Sandinist guerrilla of the contras in Nicaragua. Schatzberg (Panic in Needle Park, The Scarecrow) signs this TV movie that offers us two interesting interpreters of recent Hollywood cinema: Andy Garcia (The untouchables, The godfather part III) and Ellen Barkin (In the role of a blonde).</description>

The three, on the other hand, together with a courageous journalist, organize a column of trucks that takes on gigantic dimensions.</description>

		<description>A boy works as a "coolie" in a station, convinced that his parents were lost due to the collapse of a dam. The succession of events reveals to him, however, that his parents are still alive; the mother was forced into a tragic life by a violent individual, while the father is in prison for a crime committed by others. Among these unpredictable revelations, a girl also appears on the scene, in turn engaged in investigating the past of her family. From the ocean of Indian production, a precious testimony of an auteur cinema that we ignore. First vision TV. Original version with subtitles</description>

		<description>Deborah Kent, the widow of a diplomat killed for her anti-narcos activity, travels to the Caribbean to collect her husband's memory award. She is accompanied by her daughter and agent Farley Woods. But the presence of the American agent does not prevent the traffickers from kidnapping the girl and asking for a substantial ransom. At the appointment set by the kidnappers, the unlikely happens. Improbable is the right term to define the whole film, not just the ending. Ginty is a very small star of the action genre.</description>

		<notes>Fourth chapter of the Dirty Harry saga, the first directed by Clint Eastwood. The finale in the fog, in a ghostly and bloody funfair, is one of the most visionary moments in all of his cinema. A robust and problematic action movie, which he reiterates once more - but was it needed? - the contradictory nature of the character.</notes>

		<description>There's a strangler maniac who kills young women, preferably prostitutes, and Wess Block (Eastwood), a New Orleans homicide investigator, doesn't know where to start. He begins to frequent shady clubs, gay bars, brothels, but no clue about the maniac. Wess is divorced and lives with her two daughters. His colleague Beryl (Bujold) helps him with the investigation and also seems ready to fill the role of the missing wife and mother. A prostitute is killed shortly after talking to Wess and by then it's clear that someone is trying to frame him.</description>
		<notes>Immediately after the third "Dirty Harry" ("Come on ... get killed"), Eastwood takes a journey into perversion and sado-maso, in which the inspector and the maniac are strikingly alike. He is accompanied by Genevieve Bujold, a Canadian who from Resnais' "War is over" to Cronenberg's "Inseparables" continues not to be appreciated as she should. Director Tuggle, on the other hand, is nobody, but with Clint on stage we don't even notice it.</notes>

The latter, however, is raised by ferocious beasts thus managing to save himself. But once an adult, he tries to get justice for himself.</description>
		<notes>Director Alessandro Blasetti is inspired by the mythological blockbusters of Italian silent cinema ("Cabiria", "The last days of Pompeii"). The film is a good example of what was achieved in those years in the vein of the adventurous imagination and was awarded a surprise prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1941. In the cast also the boxing champion Primo Carnera.</notes>

Some, exhausted from prison, ask the Pope for pardon, others, including Augusto Parenti, prefer to fight to the end. This is the husband of Teresa, a commoner who holds the ranks of the rebels. When the Piedmontese enter Rome, Teresa and other women free the prisoners, but Augustus, exhausted by an illness, dies in his arms while she describes the liberation of Rome. It is a work that is part of a cycle of four films shot specifically for RAI by director Alfredo Giannetti. One of the last tests of the great Magnani, now ill.</description>

		<description>Isacco Carlini, a year old child, is the son of separated parents. With his mother he leaves Venice, where he has lived up to that moment, for the province of Varese. Since his mother works, Isaac has to fend for himself in the house during the day and he does all he can. At Christmas he returns to his father for the holidays, in Venice, and the new separation is painful.</description>
		<notes>With discrete sensitivity, but also with some forcing that is not very easy to accept, this first work tells its own thin and all too edifying story. At times the children act with affectation, probably due to a lack of direction. Fresh and polite, however, the whole.</notes>

		<description>The "Cannonball Run" is an illegal car race that sees some super-racers driven by rich jokers from all over the world engaged on the normal roads from New York to Los Angeles. The real opponent is therefore the traffic police. Several bizarre competitors take part in the race, including: a sheikh in a souped-up Rolls Royce; J.J. and his friend Victor with a fireball disguised as an ambulance; Roger Moore (in the part of himself) who drives a vehicle at 007 and there is no shortage of the usual Japanese, with a supercomputerized car, nor a couple of beautiful girls who drive a black Lamborghini.</description>

		<description>California, as we know, is the US state where everything is oversized compared to normal. Even motor racing is therefore no exception, especially if the most extravagant characters appear in large numbers among the drivers, the pit crew and the various "fauna" that gravitates around the racetracks.</description>

		<description>Every year the "Cannonball", a reckless car raid with a finish in Santa Monica, California, crosses the United States, run by authentic sports drivers but also by people who are not particularly skilled who still want to live the adventure. The race gave rise to at least four farcical films, all thrown on the side of more or less demented humor, but also all rather modest. Here, we have some spectacular shots of the racing cars struggling with the most diverse obstacles. But that's the only attraction of the film.</description>

The young Amazon is noticed by the coach of the English national team, who convinces the tutors to send her to his riding school. The seriousness and maturity shown by Sarah in the following two years deserves her a place in the Olympic team, a medal and a husband.</description>
		<notes>A somewhat belated sequel to "Grand Prix", a blockbuster from 1945 with the very young Liz Taylor and Mickey Rooney, is a sickly comic book for families that is barely saved by the interesting cast and the cunning direction of Brian Forbes ("A face naked ").</notes>

		<description>The famous corsair Vallo captures a Spanish galleon loaded with weapons. The idea is to sell them to the rebels on the island of Salina, commanded by El Libre, who is currently being held. At the request of his daughter, Vallo frees him together with the scientist Prudence and embraces his cause. The pirates, however, are not there. One of the swashbuckling masterpieces, comical and colorful, full of gimmicks, with an acrobatic Lancaster (as always without a stunt double) and the silent "shoulder" Nick Cravat.</description>

When the Ravens, in revenge, kill both of him, he begins a personal war against this tribe, for which his figure assumes a legendary stature.</description>
		<notes>Johnson is the symbol of a return to nature made not of pious illusions but of love and pain, of blood and fatigue. Extraordinary film by Pollack with an absurd Italian title: there is no character called "Corvo Rosso" !.</notes>

Before reaching the solution of the enigma, other secrets emerge, one less edifying than the other. Just sufficient as a real "thriller", the film clearly denounces what its true intent is: to accumulate itchy displays of the perverted minors who attend. the college.</description>

The submarine Silent Two sets off on his trail and, during its mission, instead discovers a cave in which a base of scientific research on genetic engineering had been installed that created horrible monsters. It is a film that, right from the title, openly declares the genre to which it belongs and the debts with respect to other films. On the one hand the metaphysical horror of The Thing, on the other the overflowing fantasy of Abyss. In this, there are only honest good intentions that have not been fully expressed, especially due to the limitation of his means.</description>

		<description>Gino is an elderly Italian-American shoe shine who, in exchange for a gift, agrees to take the blame for a murder committed by a boss. Entrusted to the surveillance of a small gangster, before going to prison, Gino allows himself a vacation that becomes fabulous because he is mistaken for a powerful mafia boss. Satire of the world of the underworld conducted as a comedy of misunderstandings, with its own morality on the fundamental dignity of the poor as opposed to the ignorant violence of the mafia. Mamet, already a famous playwright, directs a good film, even if not comparable to the previous The House of Games. Gino is played by 80-year-old Don Ameche, who was already famous in Lubitsch's day (Heaven Can Wait), and who has made a name for himself thanks to Cocoon.</description>

		<description>Birthday party at the Fairchild home, in honor of the head of the family Harvey, sixty years old, distressed by the idea of ??aging and tormented by imaginary evils. His wife Gillian, on the other hand, awaits the response of a medical examination on a tumor in the throat, but does not say anything to anyone, so as not to ruin the party. This is attended by sons and daughters, with their family problems. Finally, the results of the medical tests arrive and are reassuring.</description>
		<notes>Beneath the brilliant comedy Edwards hides more melancholy than usual, putting a lot of himself into Harvey's character: not surprisingly, there is his wife Julie Andrews and his daughter Jennifer (one of the Fairchild daughters). We laugh, but a little bitter.</notes>

		<description>In the life of Sigmund Romberg, the famous musical author of the 1920s, there were many difficulties, many successes and only one woman: Lilian Harris. After overcoming the distrust of her parents, the two marry and live happily ever after.</description>

		<description>In a period of great confusion for the Empire, Constantine returns to Rome from Gaul, and his rival Maxentius, his future brother-in-law, plots to kill him. Proclaimed emperor by his legions, after the famous vision of the cross he defeats Maxentius at the Milvian bridge, and can meet his mother Elena who had been repudiated by her husband because she was Christian. Colossal soporific, more hagiographic than historical.</description>

		<description>The sentimental and political maturation of Bruno Santini. The influence of a Communist friend and the tragic relationship with a girl will convince him to accept a job in the factory. And so his uncompromising nature is forced to change gradually, compromise after compromise.</description>
		<notes>Based on a famous novel by Vasco Pratolini, scripted by Festa Campanile and Fabio Carpi (director of "The necessary love"), the film is an ambitious foray by an author more at ease with comedy. The cast is excellent (the Deneuve-Salerno tandem sparkles), but the "socio-political" theses are really dated.</notes>

		<description>Dutch Schultz is a boss from the roaring years of New York. Dixie Dwyer is a jazz trumpet player. Dixie saves Dutch's life and for this reason becomes his protégé. The powerful Dutchman then hires the young musician at a famous nightclub, the "Cotton Club" run by another Mafia boss, Owney Madden. Dutch also has a mistress, the beautiful Vera. Soon Dixie emigrates to the West Coast and becomes famous in Hollywood, then returns, rich and famous. The inevitable happens between him and Vera. Everything revolves around a legendary club: the "Cotton Club".</description>
		<notes>A gangster movie contaminated with melons. An enthralling soundtrack. The rulers of swing possessed on the track of the most famous club of the time. Jewish, Italian and (off screen) African American mafia playing hide and seek with lead. Gere plays the cornet "live". Coppola directs amidst flashes of glory.</notes>

Betrayed in her feelings, Jeremy's woman spies on the police who ambush the smugglers from which Jeremy and John barely escape. However, a precious medallion found changes the fate of the two.</description>
		<notes>One of the masterpieces of adventure cinema, and (despite being based on a novel by John Meade Falkner) one of the most genuinely "Stevensonian" films ever made. A story of adventure and training, shot in a nocturnal and gothic technicolor, and in a format (the Cinemascope) from which Lang gets the best, even though he hates it ("only serves to shoot snakes or funerals").</notes>

		<description>Frank Harris is Deputy Hotel Manager in Chicago, but he would like to join the woman he loves in Mexico. To succeed in the difficult task he joins a group of cowboys, led by the rude Tom Rice; he takes on the task of "educating" the rookie to the harsh law of the West. At his school, Frank becomes a new man, capable of dealing with the most dangerous situations and caring more for livestock than for people: a real cowboy, finally.</description>
		<notes>The western is the genre that best suits Delmer Daves' strings; here he gives us a beautiful virile friendship film, set among large, well-photographed landscapes.</notes>

The problems of the journey are difficult, the company is risky, but Will manages to turn those boys into real men of the West.</description>

For the two intellectuals (and for the boss) it will be a lesson in ethics and politics.</description>

		<description>Six people accidentally find themselves on the same train bound for the Côte d'Azur, each with a different purpose: there are those who want to break the casino, those who have to return a lost dog to the owner, those who have to join their wife on vacation. All are subsequently suspected of the murder of a wealthy lady from Monte Carlo. Although they are innocent, they go out of their way to get into trouble.</description>
		<notes>Camerini, champion of light comedy in the Thirties, invents himself as a mystery writer, but without giving up his comic streak. The great job guarantees him a more than appreciable result, thanks also to an amazing cast. The film was remade by Camerini himself in 1971 ("I don't see, you don't speak, he doesn't hear") and in America in 1992, with John Candy, Ornella Muti and Giannini ("Seven criminals and a dachshund").</notes>

Robert Enrico is a solid action film director and Belmondo gives his character the right vigor.</notes>

		<description>An established ophthalmologist has an obsessive lover. Since his brother has connections in the criminal world, he pushes him to eliminate the woman, after which he shows himself to cry hot crocodile tears. In the meantime, an idealistic director witnesses the triumph of a vacant and moralless television personality who, moreover, takes the woman away from him.</description>
		<notes>Woody Allen does not give up his lightning jokes, but becomes bitter: his film is an attack on the weakness of consciences (you commit bad actions, but you continue to live quietly) and the inconsistency of a world that rewards inflated footballs and humiliates the honest ones. All with a heartfelt but light tone.</notes>

Laura, the daughter of Count Ludwig, suffers from nightmares and suspects she is the reincarnation of one of his ancestors. Then a series of crimes begins to occur and it turns out that there is no mystery, but simply a culprit who is also the most unsuspected of all. Foray into the horror genre of Camillo Mastrocinque, a director once famous thanks to the films with Totò. Christopher Lee is one of the most famous mercenaries in the history of cinema. He has worked with everyone regardless of the quality of the films and in this case he would have done better to decline the offer.</description>

		<description>Bruno returns from the war determined to take revenge on the person responsible for his brother's shooting. In the country, however, no one wants to talk; everyone prefers to forget, either out of selfishness, or out of desire for peace. In the long run Bruno finds the culprit, but in the meantime his desire for revenge is exhausted and in the end he gives up killing.</description>
		<notes>Only directorial proof of the writer Curzio Malaparte. The film, based on his novel of the same name, has notable formal beauties, especially for landscape photography, but it exceeds the desire to make poetry at all costs and to give mystical meanings to the story. Malaparte also composed the music.</notes>

		<description>The journey that Christopher Columbus planned to make across the ocean is opposed by the court sages, but Queen Isabella still grants him the means to leave. Convinced of reaching Asia, the navigator instead discovers new lands. His return creates jealousies among Isabella's courtiers to the point that he ends up imprisoned. Only in the end, now old, does he get justice.</description>
		<notes>Everyone knows the story: there is nothing more to discover about the Genoese sailor's enterprise. MacDonald's film plays a lot on the fictional aspects but still fails to revive the fortunes of a boring operation.</notes>

		<description>Having found the funding with King Ferdinand (Selleck) and settled the case with the inquisitor Torquemada (Brando) who suspected him of heresy, the young Christopher Columbus (Corraface) can realize his dream. On board the three caravels, he left Palos to reach the Indies by a new route. In reality what he finds are the islands of San Salvador and with them the New World. On the occasion of the fifth centenary, two films about Columbus have been released. Ridley Scott's with Depardieu and this one, written by Mario Puzo. Neither of them had much luck; a fully justified refusal, at least for what concerns this version.</description>

		<description>In a Central American country, a government is in power which is operating a very severe persecution against the Catholic religion. A missionary priest is determined to remain among his people even at the cost of his life; However, the doubt that this choice is not dictated by genuine love for one's neighbor, but by pride and self-love, grasps him. He is determined to leave when they call him to the bedside of a woman who is about to die and here the doubts are reborn. In the end he decides to save himself beyond the border, but once again they call him back to his land; this time he returns to stay permanently, but the call turns out to be a trap and for him it is martyrdom. It is certainly not one of John Ford's best films and the interesting material of Graham Greene's novel, from which it is based, is substantially wasted. The psychological definition of the protagonist is also superficial.</description>

		<description>In 1720, a few months after the death of his first wife, Johann Sebastian Bach, he married the singer Anna Magdalena Wülken. The latter keeps a diary in which she notes her impressions. Thirty years later he recalls his life alongside the brilliant musician. Music and love come together in the chronicle of a life and a brilliant musical conception. "I wanted to bring the music to the screen, I wanted to show the music to the audience," said director Jean-Marie Straub. The film is in fact a rigorous exercise in style that starts from a musical autobiography (played through 25 songs by Gustav Leonhard) and that turns into a love story.</description>

		<description>In 1925, in the midst of the fascist climate, the events of the typographer Mario and his girlfriend, Bianca, intertwined with those of the other inhabitants in a popular district of Florence. In the animated context, between personal dramas, love stories and small daily events, black political violence brutally erupts causing the death of Maciste, one of the main anti-fascists in the neighborhood.</description>
		<notes>Third feature film by Lizzani, in years of militant neorealism: a vivid and passionate historical reconstruction, from the novel by Vasco Pratolini. The self-produced film had problems with Christian Democrat censorship despite the jury's grand prize at Cannes.</notes>

		<description>Rossella (Turri) wants to leave a family that is a concentration of impossible people. At first a typist, then the secretary of an unreliable businessman, she then works with an advertiser who also tries to take advantage of her. Other vicissitudes at an ambiguous photo agency and with a moody lawyer. In the meantime, Rossella met Giuliano (Tenco), an angry protester more in words than anything else, but who almost convinces her to commit suicide.</description>
		<notes>Salce is not lacking in intelligence, but often falls into superficial speculation. A suggestive theme, but which is essentially wasted. Tenco sings some songs, among the screenwriters Goffredo Parise.</notes>

		<description>Larry, the groom's nephew, and Maria, the bride's daughter, meet at a wedding. Both married, they discover that their respective husbands and wives are having sex with each other. Larry and Maria "sympathize", but they break up so as not to create drama within their unions. When these fall apart, the two finally start a new life together. And as a side dish, there are other weddings. A makeover of the French Cousin Cousine, by Jean-Charles Tacchella (Oscar 1975), neither improves nor worsens the not particularly memorable original. Very "constructed" situations and characters for a show that is nothing more than discreet.</description>

		<description>Julian Salina, an engineer of Italian origin, lives in Baltimore. His father Joe had been helped by the Cosa Nostra, then he had paid the debt but the mafia has always continued to blackmail him. This time they ask him for an important favor: to send Julian to Italy to use him against his cousin, Giuliano, a magistrate in charge of dealing with mafia cases. Julian will have to introduce the criminals to the bunker where Giuliano lives. As soon as he arrives in Palermo, Julian realizes, however, that he will never give in to blackmail. First part of a much trumpeted television movie a few years ago as an imitation of The Octopus, but without success.</description>

A little loaded but with some merit, thanks also to the interpretation of Ingrid Thulin, a Bergmanian actress at ease in family psychodramas.</description>

		<description>Carlo is about to marry a girl from a good family, but his ex-lover manages to screw up the marriage by accusing him of theft. A modern couple shares the work: she hits the pavement, he looks after the baby. When she gets sick and cannot exercise, he offers to replace her in prostitution. Film composed of two very different episodes: the first is the classic pochade, while the next is a bitter look at an Italy that is beginning to need more and more money to satisfy the need for consumption. Sexy role for Paola Quattrini, former child prodigy and subsequently an excellent theatrical actress.</description>

		<description>Vivian is a New York university professor who traveled to Reno, Nevada to get a divorce. He lives in retirement with the elderly Frances, and here he meets the beautiful Cay, who falls madly in love with her. Vivian, troubled, tries in every way to reject the feeling that also grows inside her, but every attempt is useless. The two women leave together for New York. The homosexual theme does not make it a manifesto film. Donna Deitch first of all tells a love story, with great sensitivity and sympathy for her characters. Patricia Charbonneau is an exuberant and fascinating Cay.</description>

The story, however, ends up getting too complicated by removing tension. Thomas C.

		<description>A former agent of the DEA (the American federal drug agency) sets out on a dangerous adventure. The fault, in truth, lies with the brother. In fact, it is he who is threatened by ultramodern killers built by a mad scientist. The fight, based on sophisticated weapons, will be long, but successful. I know you won't be able to believe it, but part 2 of this Cyborg Cop has also been released. And this despite the fact that the first has never been distributed even in America, despite the fact that the protagonist is a perfect incompetent and the director an incurable mediocre. Fortunately for them, however, there is always a place in some Italian television network.</description>

		<description>Cyrano de Bergerac, poet who lived in the seventeenth century, Gascon of origin, formidable swordsman, braggart and courageous, is in love with a beautiful cousin, Rossana. She despairs of getting her love because she has a huge nose. Then he is replaced by a young and handsome friend, Cristiano, for whom he writes wonderful love letters. With the result that Rossana falls in love with the boy.</description>
		<notes>Faithfully drawn from the poem in verse that Edmond Rostand wrote about the legendary character. Gérard Depardieu, with a fake nose and a mustache, is very good both in the moments of boldness and, towards the end, in the pathetic ones (aging and death). In fact he won in Cannes.</notes>

		<description>A car runs through the forest. At a bend he lets a little boy get off, drives off again and crashes into a ravine. The boy is called Daryl, he is 12 years old, he is very intelligent, good at playing baseball, lightning fast in calculations, but he does not remember anything of his past. On the other hand, he is adored by the childless couple who took him up for adoption. The family idyll ends when two scientists arrive ... D.A.R.Y.L. in fact it is a laboratory product. The idea isn't bad, but Wincer manages to make it trivial pretty quickly. A year after Wolfgang Petersen's "The Neverending Story", Barrett Oliver hasn't changed much.</description>

		<description>Dexter Cornell is a young lost professor and writer. He realizes that he has been poisoned; aided by his pupil Sidney, he tries to survive and to find who wants to kill him and why. He learns a few things about his ex-wife's love life and stumbles upon a murky chain of passions and revenge. In the end he manages to reach the key to the enigma, but the solution of the intrigue does not serve him anyway to obtain the antidote to the deadly poison ... Remake of "Two Hours More" by Rudolph Maté with Glenn Ford (1950), already remade in '69, a thriller that does not like half measures and that does everything to keep the tension of the story alive. The couple formed by Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan is beautiful and evocative.</description>

		<description>Jim Gannon is a tough and established chief reporter who does nothing but boast the primacy of practice over studies, in the journalistic field. Invited to speak at the university, he prefers to write and present himself in the classroom as a simple student, to enjoy the effect that reading his theories will have on the academic environment. The teacher, however, is the beautiful and prepared Erica, who demolishes his presumption and steals his heart. A comedy with a slightly slender plot, but with sparkling situations. The interpretation of Clark Gable and Doris Day is not excellent. Gig Young, Erica's boyfriend is noteworthy.</description>

		<description>Prologue: after "discovering" a mysterious monolith, a group of monkeys prove to possess the spark of intelligence. The primates apply it immediately using a bone as a tool to hunt, but also as a weapon to kill others of their kind. 2001: on the Moon a mysterious monolith is discovered, identical to the prehistoric one, which receives impulses from Jupiter. Some time later, on his way to the largest planet in our solar system, astronaut Bowman is forced to "kill" the computer Hal 9000, guilty of the death of the crew. But there is no return for him either.</description>
		<notes>Visionary, "philosophical" film, bordering on rational comprehensibility: absolutely fascinating. One of the classics of cinema and founder of modern cinematic science fiction, but also an abysmal meditation on (and beyond) the history of man.</notes>

		<description>Marco is eight years old and feels misunderstood and neglected by his parents, always grappling with their economic and sentimental problems. They do all sorts of things to him: they forget his birthday, they prepare the wrong cake for him, they force him to babysit his little sister Silvietta full time. Marco can't wait to grow up and here a mysterious light transforms him into a forty-year-old, big, free and a little baby.</description>
		<notes>Second feature by Franco Amurri; in its favor it would be enough to remember that Hollywood has made a sort of remake of it ("Big" by Penny Marshall). He is lively, cleverly held on the edge of a surrealism without heaviness or abstraction.</notes>

Rinaldo and Bridget fall in love, but their happiness and the girl's entry into the world of music are seriously endangered by an artist's spite ...</description>
		<notes>It is the film that closes Alexander Hall's varied career: a musical comedy in which Metro Goldwin Mayer, as usual, carried all the possible spectacularity. The presence of Mario Lanza in the role of the young protagonist is curious.</notes>

His only friend, the Italian-American Angelo Maggio, dies of torture in a free-kick. Then comes Pearl Harbor.</description>
		<notes>From the James Jones novel. Sinatra literally begged Columbia to get the role in Eli Wallach's place, agreeing to work for just $ 8,000. In the end, Oscar for everyone (eight in total), even for Sinatra, but not for Lancaster.</notes>

		<description>Five bandits attack a farmhouse: four of these kill and rape the family, the fifth (Van Cleef) manages to save little Bill. Having grown up, Bill (Law) sets out in search of the guilty to take revenge, but he will have to share his work with Ryan, the fifth bandit, who is also eager to take revenge on the ferocity of his former comrades. Usually spaghetti western filmed in Spain with the old and innocent Van Cleef and with a herd of second-rate Italian actors. Among these, in the role of Burt, there is also Anthony Dawson or Antonio Margheriti, famous director of our local B series. Soundtrack by Ennio Morricone.</description>

		<description>Jake Tremont (Lemmon) lives with his wife away from his son who is a stockbroker on Wall Street. When the son returns home for a visit, he discovers that the father has a tumor. He then begins to care for him lovingly, discovering aspects of life that up to that moment he was completely unaware of. In fact, man lives in a dream dimension, he thinks he lives on a farm as if to redeem the grayness of everyday life. After a long illness, Jake dies: his wife, son and grandson are about to face a different and more human life, in memory of his father.</description>
		<notes>After the 1980s, films of good feelings return to the United States. In this case the theme, a bit obvious and sometimes boring, is redeemed by the excellent interpretation of Jack Lemmon.</notes>

		<description>Caroline joins her elderly parents on the Côte d'Azur: her father, who has recently had heart surgery, is an Englishman, ironic and free-thinker; the mother is, on the contrary, a very lamentable French Catholic. Caroline spends some time with them: above all the rediscovery of the relationship with her father leads her to meditate on herself, on the marriage that has gone badly, on the relationship with her son. Tavernier's meditation on life, memory, generational and emotional relationships, death. Great performance by interpreters, from the delicate and sensitive Birkin to the witty and unpredictable Bogarde, without forgetting the perfect Odette Laure (the mother).</description>

		<notes>Version of the famous "monthly story" contained in _Cuore_ (1886) by Edmondo De Amicis. Quilici uses his experiences as a documentary maker and takes advantage of the skill of the young Marco Paoletti. A film directed by Flavio Calzavara had already been drawn from the same story by the Ligurian writer in 1943.</notes>

		<description>We are in the middle of the Middle Ages. Dagobert, king of the Franks, goes on pilgrimage to Rome, to ask the Pope for forgiveness for his dissolute life. The Roman intrigues, however, placed a double of the true Pope on the chair of St. Peter; Dagobert realizes this and unmasks the usurper, but on the way back he is treacherously killed by his advisor, the monk Otarius, thirsty for power and corrupted by Roman idleness. Together with Ugo Tognazzi there is the late Coluche, a highly talented comedian and acclaimed in France, who never achieved the deserved success in Italy. Scenography by Dante Ferretti. Apart from that, it must also be said that the Middle Ages are not in the strings of our Dino Risi.</description>

The latter and his wife, remaining at his side, carry out some investigations and gradually discover the truth: the captain is innocent, the culprit is unsuspected. A thriller of good suspense written by Raymond Chandler with a precise sense of the accumulation of suspicions and the progression of the investigation. More than for directing, the film is remembered for its performers: the couple Alan Ladd, cold but intense, and Veronica Lake, with the famous blond tuft that hides one eye.</description>

The three end up living in a community of marginal bohemians who are soon interested in the same parent ... Family comedy: a decidedly unusual atmosphere for John Boorman (Excalibur, A quiet weekend of fear). Interesting work, even if the story as a whole is not particularly favorable to the style of this filmmaker who allowed himself to be convinced by his daughter Telsche, with whom he wrote the screenplay.</description>

He marries Mary St. John, of low income but introduced to high society. Mary, however, is in a relationship with a psychiatrist. Alfred gets delicate assignments from a financier and during a business trip he meets the very young Natalie. It will be with her that a happy existence will be restored. Good interpretations of Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward (his wife, in life) and Myrna Loy (The Shadow Man), but otherwise, the film, based on a popular blockbuster novel written by John O'Hara , is a long cartoon.</description>

The Jewish wife of a Reich general helps them in the enterprise. The three, however, aimed only at the precious, but, at the end of the war, a surprise is in store.</description>
		<notes>The war is only a pretext to frame what is in reality a story of espionage and action not free from imbalances and naivety. Alberto De Martino, specialist in action scenes, is still saved only in this area.</notes>

		<description>Ivan Danko, a Soviet police captain, is sent on a mission to Chicago to capture Viktor Rostavili, a dangerous drug dealer who killed his best friend and colleague. In the United States, the extrovert agent Art Ridzik is joined by the granite Danko, and the forced coexistence between the two creates many problems. Meanwhile, Viktor wreaks havoc in the city and challenges the two cops.</description>
		<notes>Walter Hill tries to replicate the success of "48 hours" by staging another "mixed" couple: after Nick Nolte and Eddy Murphy, here is Arnold Schwarzenegger "Russian" and James Belushi "American". For Danko, Walter Hill imagined a kind of modern, "masculine" and decidedly anabolic version of "Ninotchka". And the result is really fun. Superb action sequences, remarkable script, full of jokes and twists.</notes>

		<description>Lieutenant Cantrell defends Sergeant Rutledge in a trial. This is a black man, accused of killing Major Dabney and his daughter. Appearances are against the accused, but Cantrell investigates and manages to dismantle them until glimpses of a different truth emerge. The testimony of the father of a young man killed by the Indians will be decisive: with a twist the culprit will be unmasked.</description>
		<notes>A curious trial western shot almost entirely indoors, in which Ford traces the profile of a noble black soldier.</notes>

		<description>Peterson, a famous hunter, is in charge of capturing some wild elephants. The expedition is organized and, among others, little Toomai leaves with his splendid elephant but some accidents cause the little one to flee. In the night he witnesses the mythical dance of free elephants.</description>
		<notes>Producer Alexander Korda re-edited the film by having his brother Zoltan shoot additional scenes. The documentary structure of the story was thus distorted, which remains splendid in the story of the friendship between Toomai and his elephant.</notes>

		<notes>Disney production full of Irish feelings and atmospheres. Goblins, cauldrons full of treasures, adventurous stories and a Sean Connery not yet thirty years old, who in green tights certainly does not yet suspect that he is destined for the cinematic glory of 007.</notes>

		<description>A billionaire unbeknownst to his guests, he leaves his yacht swimming. On land, he swaps his clothes with those of a homeless man and states that he will give a million to those who help him. Satire emerges under the patina of comedy, thanks to Cesare Zavattini. One of the best examples of the Italian comedy of the 30s, with the couple De Sica / Noris that will later be often used by Camerini.</description>

		<notes>Lazy television transposition of an incredible true story: the screenplay is the adaptation of the autobiography of the real Mrs. Rothberg. Dramatic roles do not suit the protagonist Bernadette Peters, who some will remember as the crazy hat designer in "Slaves of New York" (1989), by James Ivory. The television director John Erman is among the authors of the famous serial "Roots".</notes>

		<description>Krzysztof, a university professor, and his son Pawel delegate their entire existence to computer programming, blindly venerating its predictions. It is the computer that decides even the most insignificant act of their daily life. Pawel wants to go skating and also entrusts the computer to calculate the thickness of the thin sheet of ice; this time, however, he will be betrayed and will die tragically. First chapter of the memorable series signed by Kieslowski. A tense story, perfectly scripted, which highlights the author's pessimism about the claim to be able to superimpose the "rigor" of science on the unpredictable reality.</description>

		<description>Orphan from birth Anka is linked to her father by a relationship of morbid attachment that sometimes seems to touch the incestuous relationship. But the discovery of a letter makes her aware that perhaps she is not her father's daughter. Kieslowski at the height of ambiguity in an atrocious interlocking of pietas and perversion. Perhaps the most "difficult" and complex episode of the Decalogue.</description>

		<description>Jacek, a restless and unemployed 20-year-old, wanders around Warsaw until he gets into a taxi and brutally kills the driver. At the trial he has as his defense Piotr, a young criminal lawyer who starts with this case and who tries, unsuccessfully, to free his client from the death penalty. The rite of execution acts as a counterpoint, equally tragic and absurd, to the crime of the young murderer. The crudest and most shocking of the chapters of Kieslowski's Decaologist and co-writer Piesiewicz. "Thou shalt not kill," says the Commandment, but does it apply only to Jacek or to society as well? A masterpiece of exceptional dramatic tension.</description>

		<description>22-year-old Majka wants to bring her daughter Ania, who lives with her grandmother, to Canada from Poland. Majka had her very young, from the relationship with Wojtec, her teacher, and to avoid the scandal, the little girl was registered as the daughter of her grandmother, and everyone believes her to be so, even Ania herself. But Majka one day kidnaps the little girl, and then he will have to "give her back" to the presumed mother. Kieslowski and Piesiewicz develop the theme of the commandment "Thou shalt not steal". Love as an alibi for an appropriation that generates devastating fractures, and for the possession of a "stolen goods" which is still a victim.</description>

		<description>The stories of Ser Ciappelletto, who died in the odor of sanctity, and of Giotto's pupil bind seven others: Andreuccio is robbed by a woman who pretends to be her half-sister, but makes up for herself by stripping the body of a high prelate of all the jewels; Masetto, pretending to be deaf and dumb, enters a convent of nuns by which he lets himself be seduced; Lisabetta keeps the head of her beloved, killed by her brothers, in a jar of basil; Caterina and Riccardo crown their dream of love with marriage; from the afterlife Tingoccio reveals to the fearful Meuccio that making love is not a sin; pretending to want to turn her into a filly, donno Gianni enjoys the wife of a naive farmer; the unfaithful Peronella induces her husband to sneak into a jar to prevent him from discovering her lover. The film inaugurates the trilogy with which Pasolini intended to attack the sexophobic culture. Boccaccio's bourgeois world is transformed into a mythical popular golden age, the reign of a joyful and innocent absence of taboos.</description>

		<description>Four men and four women from the university environment of French Canada meet for a party in a beautiful country house. The men prepare the food in the kitchen, the women do gymnastics in the gym, and in the meantime we chat. And from the speeches the vanity of useless existences emerges, aimed only at the satisfaction of pleasures while around the world the world collapses. Desolate message of a film that uses the pedal of the grotesque and counterpoint with some beautiful exteriors the useless chatter of characters pervaded by the "great cold" of feelings. The title is ironic, the decline is of the Western world as a whole.</description>

		<description>In an Italian provincial town, young people of the rich bourgeoisie amuse themselves between boring parties and squalid loves. A poor girl is also introduced into the tour who, pregnant, will force the rich Alberto to marry her; and a city doctor, Mario. The good time of these "dolphins" will last only a year: between marriages and bankruptcies all their hypocrisies and falsehoods will come to the surface.</description>
		<notes>Social, moral, generational denunciation of the Italian provincial bourgeoisie. Maselli's didactic vice comes out, supported here by Alberto Moravia (screenwriter together with the director, Ennio De Concini and Aggeo Savioli). A cross-section of the young bourgeoisie, cruel but irremediably dated.</notes>

		<description>Betty returns from the supermarket to prepare lunch for a little boy, Tommy. To delay the hour of his death, the young man reads three horror stories to this anthropophagous cook: a student awakens a murderous mummy; a cat kills the hired killer against him; a painter violates the pact of silence. Eventually Tommy will "cook" the cook.</description>
		<notes>Cinema version of a television series launched by specialist George A. Romero (screenwriter here). Rising tension, a lot of care in the realization, excellent performance of the interpreters for a film inspired by three stories respectively by Arthur Conan Doyle, Stepehn King and Michael McDowall.</notes>

		<description>Also as editor of the city newspaper, Father Bob Kosler investigates a series of inexplicable murders involving priests and nuns. The only clue: a black rosary left in the hands of the victims. Helping Father Bob is the beautiful journalist Pat Lennon. The mystery is deep, but one day the priest receives a chilling confession from a man who tells him he is the murderer and accuses the Church of what he is doing ...</description>
		<notes>The layout is traditional but also well-designed, always kept in the right tension and enriched by those elements (incest, ambiguity of the priestly role) capable of capturing the viewer.</notes>

After the death of another girl, Eddy discovers that the crimes are caused by the bottle of a perfume (which suddenly ignites in contact with a light source) sent as a gift to the victims by a mysterious homicidal madman.</description>
		<notes>The plot is that of a thriller, but the assumption, completely absurd and unlikely, consciously slips into farce. Too bad that the whole is completely ramshackle and that, above all, it does not make you laugh.</notes>

At the same time in District 27, a new manager has arrived who despises the methods of the so-called old guard. Edward, dividing his time between hospital and office problems, begins an investigation into two murders, which his boss dismisses as anomalous.</description>

		<description>A mysterious and ghostly figure who wanders behind the scenes of a theater kills a dancer following a macabre and dark ritual. Detective Joe Garvey (Kristofferson) investigates. He meets Tinsel, an insolent but ultimately very tender girl, sister of the murdered one, and engages in a psychological war with her, convinced that he is aware of useful elements to unravel the problem. A rather conventional film that, however, manages to slip away smoothly until the happy ending. Kristofferson (Heaven's Gate), here in a role very congenial to him, is well flanked by a peppered Drew Barrymore.</description>

		<description>Jerry is a radio speaker who supported the victorious campaign of Daniels, the aspiring mayor of the city. When he notices that Daniels, whom he thought he could maneuver as he pleased, is determined to get serious, he gets rid of him by putting a bomb on his car. The police begin the investigation which turns out to be more difficult than expected. But some traces present at the crime scene and a note found in the mayor's pockets lead to the solution of the case. Almost documentary in style, it was Fred Zinneman's first feature film that fits in well with the detective genre.</description>

The investigations are conducted by inspector Nico Girardi, who discovers that someone had replaced the deceased's medicines with arsenic tablets. At first the suspicions are directed to the restaurant staff (the maître Vincenzo and the driver Bombolo), but soon they focus on the owner of the restaurant, who does not hesitate, to defend himself, to kidnap the inspector's wife and child.</description>
		<notes>One of the latest films starring the inspector "Monnezza" (Milian) assisted by the couple Cannavale-Bombolo. Example of Z series cinema that disappeared in the early 1980s.</notes>

The delicate investigations are entrusted to the bizarre and shrewd Inspector Cockrill, who manages to solve the case with the help of Dr. Barnes. A solid yellow, but made more pleasant by a thread of humor that runs through it. Professional direction and impeccable interpreters.</description>

In this era of revaluation, it is even fun to see the Cuban actor again at work, who, moreover, had very different potentials.</notes>

His father sends him a former fellow student, Tom Ripley, to persuade him. But he sniffs the opportunity to seize Philippe's wealth, and the first step is to kill him ... From a novel by Patricia Highsmith (from which "The Talent of Mr. Ripley" was also taken), René Clément has I make a film of great formal elegance and strong dramatic tension (also to demonstrate to the young people of the "nouvelle vague" that his "dad's cinema" could be excellent). Excellent trio of interpreters, guided with great sensitivity.</description>

Saved in extremis by Mrs. Sherman, she finds the word again in shock.</description>

		<description>Vancini's film retraces and reconstructs, even with the minutia of the documentary, the story of the assassination of Giacomo Matteotti by the fascists. At times action film, at times more reflective, in the 1970s it was the classic historical reflection film for schools. The reconstruction of the environment is accurate, and the story is told clearly but without too much weight. A decent example of the "political cinema" of those years.</description>

Tony quickly adapts to the new situation and, with a devious deposition, has her accused of murder.</description>
		<notes>For this classic, Hitchcock shot the murder scene with the three-dimensional system to accentuate the visual effect of the scissors in the foreground, but the authentic suggestion of the film lies, as always, in the suspense.</notes>

The two marry, but some circumstances raise the suspicion in the woman's mind that her husband is the murderer of the previous landlady. Joan Crawford, now on its way to sunset boulevard, is paired with a Jeff Chandler at the height of his career (destined to be short-lived) in a thriller that is supposed to be atmospheric, but which is of little interest. An interesting element is the beautiful photograph by Charles Lang jr.</description>

The fault, poor thing, is not his, but a curse that struck him when he was still small. Although she knows she is risking her skin, she does not leave him and, indeed, it will be her love that will save him from that curse.</description>
		<notes>To be a comedy you don't laugh much, to be a thiller there is no suspense. Even the cast does not contribute to the success of the enterprise.</notes>

		<description>Heinz, a young psychopath just released from prison, gets a date with Linda, a girl he had already attacked in the past, and kidnaps her. However, the young woman manages to warn two friends who are on their trail together with the police. Breathtaking showdown in the final at high altitude.</description>
		<notes>Set in the Bronx in the mid-1960s, the film stages a raw but reliable story with a strong impact, with unexpected melodramatic implications and with no break in rhythm. Turturro is crazy and does it well. The James N. Howard soundtrack is evocative.</notes>

		<description>Jane, Aaron and Tom are three journalists who work on private television. The woman is strong-willed and bright, Aaron is the smartest of the three, but is unable to emerge, Tom is charming, easygoing but not very prepared. Professional and sentimental relationships are intertwined, finally pushing the three on different paths.</description>
		<notes>Dreams, opportunisms, precariousness of affections, professional and existential disappointments: the human panorama that eventually emerges is rather disheartening. The general tone is that of a bitter comedy: the humor is always poisoned and the ending is marked by melancholy. Of note is the "cameo" by Jack Nicholson.</notes>

		<description>Prague. Rabbi Löw, who predicts a catastrophe to the detriment of the Jews, models a large clay statue, the Golem, and gives it life, then using it as a servant. Miriam, Löw's daughter, is in love with Florian, but the Golem, incited by the rabbi's assistant, kills the young man, kidnaps the girl and sets fire to the Jewish quarter. It will be a child, by chance, to cause the undoing of the "monster". Reworking of the 1914 film of the same name, also directed by Wegener with Henrik Galeen and inspired by a Jewish legend, a powerful metaphor for the conflict between intelligence and brute force, the film is a masterpiece of expressionist visionary, with astonishing anthropomorphic architecture (by Hans Pölzig) and prodigious lighting effects in the photography of Karl Freund.</description>

		<description>The life of Giuliana, the young wife of an engineer, could go by without problems, but the woman is not happy. Due to the shock suffered in a car accident, she is the victim of a depression and is tempted by the idea of ??suicide. She meets Corrado and becomes his lover, but this is not enough to heal her.</description>
		<notes>Consumer society, industrial pollution, the inhumanity of technological civilization are the central topics of this film, in which Antonioni summarizes all his pessimism. As for the formal aspect, the extraordinary result obtained by the director in the research on color should be underlined. The sequence on the beach of Budelli, in Sardinia, is memorable.</notes>

		<description>Duel McCall arrives in Bisby in search of Nora, his great, lost love. The arrival in the village of an alleged outlaw like him, with a heavy price on his head, creates havoc. Arrested, our hero offers to infiltrate the gang that is organizing the assault on the armored stagecoach with which the bank transfers the gold. After negotiating freedom in this way, Duel fulfills his mission and thwarts the robbery. It won't help him much: the death of the sheriff with whom he had found an agreement forces him to leave, an unhealthy guest. Television Western that captures without flashes some places and characters typical of the genre.</description>

		<description>Piovarolo, a small town, where railway traffic consists of a single train a day, is the seat where, in 1922, Antonio La Quaglia was assigned as stationmaster. Absolute boredom, a loveless marriage and, what's more, the wife's non-Arianity which becomes a big problem with the racial laws. Then the fascist regime falls, but La Quaglia will never have the much desired transfer.</description>
		<notes>Without ever raising the tone of voice and while maintaining the comedy cadences, the film expresses a certain satirical charge in the portrait of its protagonist. Curiously, in the early 1940s, Paolella had been, as a film critic, the author of numerous anti-Semitic articles.</notes>

Over time, however, his conduct of competition becomes a bit too unscrupulous, so much so that the charming lover, who has become his financier in the meantime, leaves him.</description>

		<notes>A detective story that collects in the cast some of the most popular names at the end of the 60s. A few obvious attempts at social criticism and customs are not enough to make the film go out of the number of series products.</notes>

		<description>In a large Parisian hotel the stories of some characters cross until the tragic dissolution of the plot. Detective Prospero, with his nephew Neveu, is investigating a murder that took place two years earlier; an airplane pilot and his wife are in crisis, the woman would like to return with Jim, a boxing impresario in trouble with the mafia. Starting from an unlikely "homage" to the detective genre, Godard mounts one of his cinematic devices where the narration turns into a very personal experimentation. Intellectual provocation, meditation on the "state of cinema", technical research are the main elements.</description>

To be sure she hires Lew Harper, a private detective, incorruptible, ironic and devoid of any illusion about life. Harper immediately finds the driver, but just as quickly they kill him. This is another who made money thanks to oil and thanks to the bribes he handed out to politicians. Lew does not let himself be intimidated but, after a series of corpses, he begins to suspect that the rotten one is right in the Deverhoe house.</description>

		<description>Charged by Elaine Sampson, on the advice of Attorney Graves, to investigate the disappearance of her rich husband, Detective Lew Harper (Newman) begins to delve into the man's friendships. The investigations, however, do not give any results on the contrary, Harper often throws himself into bad situations, from which the providential arrival of Graves saves him. Only after the discovery of Sampson's body will Harper unmask the culprit. It is a film vaguely inspired by the Chandlerian style and atmosphere. Discreet in the setting, poised between the psychological digging of the characters and the search for suspense.</description>

The authorities try to hide the fact by eliminating all those who are aware of it, but the scientist finds two unexpected allies in an athlete who is spending the holidays with his wife. The trio will be able to get the news to the newspapers and those responsible will be punished. Inspired by the success of The Chinese Syndrome, the film was shot entirely in Australia and finds its strengths in the harsh criticism of the excessive power of the multinationals and the excellent action scenes, made without resorting to special effects.</description>

Discontinuous values, but the only "thud" is that of the first episode, in which Villaggio is unable to redeem the weakness of the original idea. After a quarter of a century, Sordi re-discovered his first successful character, the "American in Rome" Nando Moriconi.</notes>

		<description>The Texas town of Juno City is bullied by the vicious bandit Clayton's gang. Even the sheriff and the judge, one drunkard and the other fearful, suffer the oppression. The only one who tries to oppose this state of affairs is Father John who is killed for this. The son then sets off in search of the father's twin brother, known as Diamante Lobo who, a skilled gunslinger, defeats the Claytons. It is one of the late followers of the Italian western. Here we try to ennoble the genre by inserting the figure of the shepherd who tries to oppose violence, the film is less than mediocre. The cast (wasted) is of a high level, the director is actually called Gianfranco Parolini.</description>

		<description>To save the life of her husband, the Count of Brézé, accused of treason, the beautiful Countess Diana of Poitiers places herself under the orders of King Francis I. The latter entrusts him with the education of her son Henry, betrothed to Caterina de 'Medici. Enrico is nice, but a bit rough and he really needs someone to teach him good manners. The prince decides to marry Catherine only when Diana promises him that she will stay at the court. But their relationship is discovered. Meanwhile, Francesco I dies in the war, and other characters of the court die at the hands of the Medici.</description>

		<description>Amsterdam, 1942. The Germans occupy the country and persecute the Jews. A Jewish family, that of the Frank family, is locked up in an attic of Mr. Frank's spice factory with some friends. Despite the harsh living conditions, little Anna manages to have moments of lightheartedness and entrusts her thoughts to the pages of her diary. But one bad day the Franks are arrested and deported.</description>
		<notes>Published all over the world, the girl's diary was also brought to the theater and director George Stevens made a rather serious film from it, entrusting the role of the 13-year-old protagonist to a girl who had never made cinema, Millie Perkins.</notes>

		<description>Television version (a film was also made in 1959 under the direction of George Stevens) of the drama of little Anne Frank, forced to live for two years in the attic of a house in Amsterdam, to escape Nazi persecution. Of the Frank family only the father Otto will survive. Flat television version of the famous diary, definitely inferior to that (already sweetened) by George Stevens.</description>

		<description>For Dekker, being a killer is a job like any other: no emotions, no doubts, just a job. He should take one last shot, then retire, buy the house he lives in and live in it with Sheila. But the last blow is strange, the woman to be killed is a drug addict and the instigator is her husband. Dekker realizes in time that the woman does not match her husband's description.</description>
		<notes>Based on a play by Kenneth Pressman, who is also the screenwriter, the film does not exaggerate with the action sequences, but rather lingers on the psychologies of the characters. Forest Whitaker easily eats all the other actors, including fatal women.</notes>

		<description>Thymiane, daughter of a pharmacist, is raped by her father's assistant and made pregnant. The child is born but dies almost immediately. Thymiane is locked up in a correctional facility, from which she escapes to work in a brothel. Here she meets a young man but after the latter's death she marries his uncle, becoming a respectable lady. Melodrama about the complex career of a girl who goes through the hell of prostitution to reach the glories of bourgeois society: director Pabst sarcastically portrays the crimes and misdeeds of a crumbling society, making use of the morbid charm of the beautiful and gifted Louise Brooks.</description>

When he takes the girl away from his colleague Steve (Damon), he wants to write a book with which to make known both the professional improprieties and the amatory nonchalance of Joe. But then Joe himself risks his life to save Steve's. Roger Corman, in his frenetic activity as director and producer, has made notable films but also others of modest caliber. This is pure trade, with no wing flaps.</description>

Guest of a painter, the girl falls in love with the artist and resumes her true appearance. Many pitfalls await you at the gate.</description>
		<notes>Rather badly received at its release, the film has an unconventional story and a narrative structure that had the courage to mix genres, emotions, tensions. The cast is extraordinary: Hepburn dressed as a man, her father Edmund Gwenn and the cheeky Cary Grant in the role of an actor.</notes>

		<description>America, 1880. In a troupe of actors fleeing creditors, the law and the Indians, Tom, the manager, loves Angela, the showgirl. To win her, he must contend with Marbry, an outlaw who is already a lover of the woman who joins them on the eventful journey to Bonanza.</description>
		<notes>The only pseudo western directed by George Cukor in his career. Although the story is taken from a short story by Luis L'Amour (the most famous western novelist), the atmosphere is light-hearted. The touch in the master is recognized in the definition of the characters and in the life scenes of the artists.</notes>

		<description>A Canadian pilot insinuates the suspicion that Sir Mark Loddon, whom he met in a German concentration camp, was actually killed by his double, who thus took his place. Sir Loddon, in reality, is authentic but suffers from amnesia that make his position fragile. Despite this, under pressure from his wife, he files a complaint and is forced to face the trial, during which the truth dramatically breaks through. Asquith is a director with an aura of unmistakable Britishness. Procedural drama constructed with flash-back interlacing Dirk Bogarde's performance in double role is exceptional.</description>

Endless pitfalls, characters playing double-crosses, a few loyalists of the protagonist to fight with him the holy war of the law. Exemplary cinematographic transposition of the iconography of the "stripes", a very tasty masquerade game, an elegant show for a classy fun. Warren Beatty leads a group of colleagues who collaborate with amused professionalism (the extraordinary series of character actors, from Charles Durning to Dick Van Dyke, from Kathy Bates to James Caan, Paul Sorvino, Henry Silva).

		<description>George Webber is a famous and rich musician, but he has recently passed his forties and is going through an existential crisis. Crossing a wedding procession by chance, he is struck by the beauty of the bride. Learning that the beautiful stranger is on her honeymoon in Acapulco, he decides to follow her. Here, after a few days, he saves the life of the woman, who offers him a night to thank him.</description>
		<notes>Blake Edwards makes "Ten" after three consecutive films dedicated to the adventures of Inspector Clouseau, returning to the tones of the romantic comedy; the taste is naturally the bittersweet one typical of his humor; the sophisticated lightness of the touch is reminiscent of films such as "Operation Crêpes Suzettes" or "Breakfast at Tiffany's".</notes>

But only after sending the terrible seven plagues does the pharaoh agree to let them go. Later, regretting having succumbed, he pursues them with his army, but is swallowed by the Red Sea. Moses, having received the tablets of the Law, dies, now old, seeing only the Promised Land from afar.</description>
		<notes>The film has become the quintessential example of blockbusters. Particularly sumptuous, for the time, were the special effects (awarded with the Oscar) and De Mille's use of the VistaVision panoramic format.</notes>

		<description>Leo Kessler (Bronson), serving as an officer in the LAPD, has to deal with the heinous murders of some young women. Investigations lead him to suspect an apparently harmless employee. He is indeed the killer maniac but, being mentally ill, he cannot be convicted. Kessler at that point is not there and decides to take justice on his own. The character of the lone executioner is certainly not nice. But in this case the film works, thanks also to the direction of Jack Lee Thompson, author, among other things, of the first "Promontory of fear", the one with Peck and Mitchum.</description>

		<description>In 1869 a group of ten men, Major Wesley Powell, his brother Walter, and eight other explorers, prepare for an expedition to sail the Colorado River for the first time. They will discover one of the most beautiful regions of America. The film, produced by Disney and based on the memoirs of the real Major Powell, is deadly boring. It should be an adventure movie, but there is very little action.</description>

		<description>A lively eight-year-old girl returns home from the boarding school where she spent most of her still short life. Lived up to that moment between luxuries and comforts, pampered and revered by everyone, she is now faced with a very different reality: her beloved father is in fact in very bad economic conditions following a financial meltdown. Contrary to what any brat would do, however, she does not despair.</description>

		<description>There is an old case that still haunts Joe Steiner (Widmark). A murder that Joe was unable to solve when he was still a policeman and that only comes out now that he has become a private detective. Chris Graham (Quinlan), a girl obsessed with a masked individual who haunts her, asks Joe for help and he begins to think that perhaps there is some connection between the two cases. The story behind this cable TV movie is pretty well known. But Widmark manages to keep the attention awake and director Douglas Hickox (that of Bloody Oscar) puts everything else into it.</description>

		<description>Mark, whom Celia married after love at first sight, behaves strangely and has a mania for faithfully reconstructing rooms that have been the site of crimes. One day Celia discovers that one of these rooms reproduces hers. The story is told through the eyes of the protagonist, with the help of an intense commentary from the voiceover.</description>
		<notes>One of the most beautiful sequences concerns the process that Mark intends on himself in a dream, giving substance to that criminal obsession that represents the cornerstone of Lang's imaginary universe. Wisely studied lights, shots and sets complete the great charm of the film.</notes>

		<description>A mother and two children in Indochina. The mother bought land and tries to make it arable by protecting it with a dam. Instead, the daughter believes that the way out is her rich lover. The story, taken from the novel by Marguerite Duras, is the same as the "Lover", with developments in a "pre-catastrophic" direction. Duras complained about the film version.</description>

		<description>The Claw, a man with a steel hook instead of his right hand, is the leader of a gang responsible for a fur theft, as well as killing a guardian. Detective Dick Tracy investigates and discovers that someone is hiding behind the gang who is very high up. It is the third film in the series dedicated to the famous comic book hero invented by Chester Gould. On the occasion, Ralph Byrd replaces Morgan Conway in the lead role. In the end, the villain who hooks himself to the wires of a tram with his hook and dies charred is not a bad blow, but this is also the only original idea of ??a film, which otherwise shines neither for inventiveness, nor by rhythm.</description>

		<description>John Dillinger was one of the most determined and bloodthirsty bandits of the thirties in America, so much so that he was nicknamed the "public enemy number one". A motivated and determined policeman chases him, captures him but Dillinger escapes; The man of the law, however, eliminates, one by one, the accomplices of the gangster and finally awaits him at the exit of a Chicago cinema. Milius (on his debut as a director) does not isolate the ferocity of the criminal but places it in a time of ferocity: the violence of the outlaws and that of the policemen appear even similar.</description>

		<description>Carmine Bonavia (Belushi), candidate for mayor of New York, supports an antiprohibitionist line on the drug problem. He goes with Carrie (Rogers) on their honeymoon to Palermo, the land of his ancestors, where the mafia involves him in a murder to make him change his mind. The intentions are certainly good: to address the issue of drug trafficking in a film that combines the spectacle with reflection. But the most laudable intentions are not enough to guarantee the result. The fact that the production was destined for the international market does not justify the quantity of clichés (including narrative) about Palermo and Sicily.</description>

		<description>Junie is a young woman disfigured by her sadistic lover; Arthur is instead a tormented epileptic; Finally, Warren is a homosexual with paralysis in the legs. The three decide to leave the hospital where they are admitted to live together in a cottage. By giving each other spiritual support they manage, despite all the problems, to escape from the loneliness to which they were condemned and can restore meaning to their existence. Otto Preminger creates with this film a small jewel of sensitivity and cruelty that avoids any risk of "cuteness" or, worse, of pathetism.</description>

The police are groping in the dark and to stir the waters they use Megan Carter, a young and enterprising journalist who is taking an interest in the case. The girl unwittingly lends herself to the game and ends up bringing up a liquor wholesaler named Michael Gallagher as a possible murderer. The investigation leads a friend of Gallagher's to suicide, but the crime remains a mystery. Film-denunciation of "assault" journalism. Pollack outlines complex characters and situations with his usual skill; Paul Newman and Sally Field don't disappoint.</description>

In the town where he lives, then, there is a very broad interpretation of the Second Amendment, in particular as regards the right to go around armed. But when his wife and daughter are killed in a gunfight, he too begins to doubt. The topic will also be interesting, but Bloom manages to make it so boring that the viewer is convinced almost immediately that the use of weapons is not always inappropriate. Yet "Sight and Sound" put him in the top 100 video films of '95.</description>

Not only a great comedian, but also a great author, Keaton has conquered with his films a place of honor in the Olympus of filmmakers. His art, based on mimicry and pure rhythm, could hardly express itself at the same levels in sound cinema. After 1929, in fact, its decline begins, from which it will rise again episodically with some appearances, including the memorable ones in "Limelight" by Chaplin and "Sunset Avenue" by Wilder.</description>

		<description>Alan is a mature mystery writer, alcoholic, married to young Lola. Despite having been together for less than a year, their marriage is already in crisis. To save the bond and find inspiration, Alan and Lola take a vacation in Haiti. Here too, however, he does not shy away from gallant adventures and moreover kills a man who wanted to rob him. However, someone saw him and blackmails him.</description>
		<notes>Everything is made more murky by the investigation of a corrupt policeman with little interest in uncovering the truth. From a novel by David Goodis (that of "Pull on the pianist") a slightly phony erotic noir that upset the fans of Marceau, fresh from the "Time of apples" in which Brasseur played his father.</notes>

		<description>A pizza chef leaves from Positano to work in a hotel in the North and while traveling he meets Romy, an Italian-German girl. The hotel manager seems tough, but then he lets himself be moved by the touching songs of the Neapolitan employee. Nino tries to re-establish contact with his fiancée Maria, who has remained in the village, but Carlo, his rival in love, manages to prevent him, also insinuating the worm of jealousy in the girl's heart.</description>
		<notes>The tear-jerking story is little more than a pretext for Nino D'Angelo's singing performances which, moreover, you could not ask for more.</notes>

		<description>An American family decides to sell everything and abandon the quiet existence they had conducted up to that point and buy a boat. Objective: to live for a while in the Pacific, experiencing the "link" with the boundless sea and with a life model less dominated by consumerism. However, the boat is shipwrecked in a storm and the unwary group finds themselves fighting for their own survival. Thirty-eight terrible days will be spent on a dinghy, totally at the mercy of the ocean. The theme is a bit old, the staging predictable. Photography is saved, as usual in this type of film. Sure, it's a little sad to see Ali MacGraw reduced to this to work.</description>

		<description>Quick with the gun, Jason McCullough is forced, for economic reasons, to accept the post of sheriff in the turbulent town of Calendar. One day, however, he arrested Joe Danby for murder and in this way exposes himself to the revenge of the father and brother of the criminal. The Danbys, among other things, repeatedly try to free Joe and kill Jason. They also hire killers for this purpose, but they do not achieve their purpose.</description>
		<notes>The director Burt Kennedy and the screenwriter Bill Bowers know "serious" westerns, and in this parody they dig with irony and a taste for the paradox in the clichés and in the accompanying characters typical of the genre.</notes>

		<description>Jack Noah is a mediocre New York actor who is working on a cheap movie in the Caribbean. He is hired by the prime minister of the state of Parador to replace the recently deceased dictator he resembles. Jack accepts the job and ends up enjoying it so much that he begins to rule seriously. Of course it doesn't go down to the Prime Minister, but everything finds an accommodation. Farce, brilliant comedy, socio-political criticism, cinematic citations are intertwined in the film. Mazursky wants to have fun by scratching, but scratches aren't the kind that leave scars. Good interpreters, especially Richard Dreyfuss in the role of the shabby actor.</description>

		<description>Fielding Mellish (Allen) is a test engineer with a few problems with cars and a lot of problems with women. He meets Nancy, a girl engaged in collecting signatures for the Latin American state of Bananas, and falls in love with her. Disappointed by her refusal, he leaves for Bananas where he risks his life at the first dinner, ends up in a rebel military camp and is then appointed President. Back in the US, he was arrested for subversive activities, sentenced and then released. Finally, he succeeds in marrying Nancy and consuming the wedding night on live television.</description>
		<notes>A first-rate Allen, pure and demonic comedian. The film is discontinuous but has many compelling moments and its joint satire of imperialism and leftism is often effective.</notes>

		<description>A cabaret artist, Jack Martin, is a true genius of imitations: in particular he bears a striking resemblance to a famous aviator, Duran, a veteran of the world tour, whom he imitates to perfection. Jack, at the request of the aviator's associates, replaces him at a party while Duran is on a business trip. Duran's competitor is present at the party and this unleashes an incredible series of misunderstandings that will also involve the aviator's wife.</description>

		<description>Django the gunslinger arrives in Tombstone and discovers that his brother Steve has been killed, the bank robbed and the banker's daughter, Maria, kidnapped. Everyone points to Sartana as guilty. Therefore, it will be a challenge to the death between Django and Sartana. But, perhaps, the truth is another.</description>
		<notes>It derives (very) trash from the "spaghetti western" with Ardisson and Kendall (Stella) "clones" of Gianni Garko and Franco Nero, respectively historical Sartana and Django of Italian cinema. The level is very low, the script vulgar and the direction sloppy. Speaking of direction, behind the pseudonym of William Redford lies Pasquale Squitieri.</notes>

Spaghetti-western barely passable which is saved only by the presence of Lupo. The only western parenthesis for the famous protagonist of many television dramas.</notes>

		<description>The young Chance, to achieve success, lives with Alexandra, diva on the avenue of the sunset. For her he abandoned a woman younger and in love with him, who had previously become pregnant and had an abortion. Chance, in order to get a film role, endures the whims of his patron. Having regained her success, she abandons it.</description>
		<notes>Based on a Tennessee Williams play, the film has been lightened of its harsher traits and added a happier ending. It remains an aptly masterful, especially for the interpretations of Newman and the two women: Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight.</notes>

A nice portrait ...</description>
		<notes>Director Mike Leigh ("Secrets &amp; Lies") makes one of his best vitriolic comedies, a biting analysis of a microcosm without stylistic embellishments and with a taste of bitter truth. A "chronicle" cinema, of pure essentiality but of absolute excellence.</notes>

		<description>At the end of the Napoleonic wars a woman returns home and meets the man she had loved ten years earlier. But he doesn't recognize her, so she decides to pass herself off as her niece. Never ending misunderstandings will arise against a background still tormented by conflicts.</description>
		<notes>George Stevens ("The Rider of the Lonely Valley") is a great director this time at work with the handbrake on. Hepburn, however, is very good and holds up all the comedy by herself. Based on a work by James Matthew Barrie.</notes>

		<description>Despite his ambitions as a writer, Marcello has adapted to the role of a worldly journalist. Thus he knows and frequents the golden world that gravitates around via Veneto, absorbs its mentality and copies its behavior. His love life is also unruly due to the occasional adventures that wear down his relationship with Emma, ??the woman he lives with. Not even the tragedy of the intellectual Steiner shakes him.</description>
		<notes>Fellini confesses his own crisis (which is the crisis of an era) giving voice to his faithful alter ego Mastroianni, and guiding him through the fresco of a city painted with lyrical despair. Masterpiece.</notes>

		<description>Discovered descendant and heir of a noble English family, the De Mostri family in full force, characterized by the fantastic ugliness of all its members, sets sail for the old continent to take possession of the ancestral castle. But while the newcomers are good and ugly, the British relatives who await them are beautiful, evil, and above all determined to get rid of the "intruders" by any means. It will not be easy. Comic reversal of stereotypes, in the wake of a successful television series, "The Munsters" (a bit in the wake of the "Addams Family") and polite revenge of the upstart of the new world on their antagonists, haughty (and perverted) "genuine Anglo-Saxons" .</description>

		<description>Maremma, 1847. Two white-hearted cowboys, Lupo (Hendel) and Edo, chased for a robbery, first run into a terrible brigand, then find refuge in the villa of the Marquis Ombraviva. Here, they become the guinea pigs of a philosophical bet between the landlord and a tutor who followed Rousseau. In order to demonstrate the validity of the Enlightenment theories, according to which education can make a prince of every rough "savage", Edo will be elegantly educated, while Lupo will be left to himself. The paradoxical fold of the story vividly depicts the great "confusion under the Italian sky" on the eve of the upheavals of '48. Paolo Hendel is in his first appearance as a protagonist.</description>

Here the girl comes into contact with other realities similar to hers: a dishonored young woman who in turn attempted suicide, a woman who would like to die believing she had lost her child, an elderly lady who has just killed herself.</description>
		<notes>Especially later on "Tomorrow is too late", again by Leonide Moguy (notable success of the previous year) which, however, was a half fiasco. Also because the author was missing the important protagonists of the first film (from Vittorio De Sica to Ave Ninchi). Redundant and preaching.</notes>

		<description>In the 24 hours before the wedding with Susy, while the preparations are in full swing, in Jerry's mind the memories of his previous loves resurface, in particular that of Simona who, already married, would still like to run away with him. His friends, on the occasion of the bachelor party, "give him" a woman Rita who, however, as a lover and nocturnal confidant ends up falling in love with Jerry. After a series of interminable further ups and downs, which seem to definitively compromise the marriage. Jerry and Susy finally meet to exchange their "yes", in the cathedral of Mantua, under the eyes of Simona and Rita. Stupid and vulgar comedy. Calà's success remains a mystery.</description>

		<description>Sent to a retirement home for artists by their small private broadcaster, Maurizio (Nichetti) and Mariangela (Melato) undergo an incredible experience. An airplane of a mysterious station, "TV Etere" lands and, through an equally mysterious radiation, pushes all present to joy and dance. The epidemic spreads quickly, so much so as to require the intervention of the authorities who will sadly succeed in restoring order. Third film directed by Nichetti who had not yet recovered from the immediate and dazzling success of Ratataplan. All in all, a fun, but not overwhelming film.</description>

To protect herself from a raging storm, Eileen invites Mike to Adam's house, who is absent for work, and here she finds clear evidence that Adam lied to her in a closet.

		<notes>Many small stories with actors "taken from the street", as was agreed in the neorealist era. However, the attempt of the skilled craftsman Luciano Emmer to build a film-fresco, which offers a glimpse of the contradictions and reality of Italy of those years, cannot however be said to be successful even if his genuinely popular streak makes him sketch some tasty sketch .</notes>

		<description>The film develops into the story of three distinct but parallel episodes which take place simultaneously on a football Sunday. A former footballer sees his hopes of finding a new job fade, his wife almost leaves him, but his daughter saves the marriage. A retiree makes plans believing he has done thirteen at the football pools, but he is wrong. At the stadium, the young Julius meets a woman who is contemplating killing her lover and makes sure that this does not happen.</description>
		<notes>Some slowness and naivety, in a film based on a radio play by Vasco Pratolini and Giandomenico Giagni. Pleasant, sketchy and with some bitter hints. Majano will become one of the best known directors of television dramas of the 1960s.</notes>

		<description>A German tourist is attracted to a girl, but she morbidly prefers his semi-deficient brother. Strange complicity between a bride and the mother-in-law who spies on her amorous effusions with her son. A shoemaker-barber can't get rid of a dog with a blue spot on its face. A simpleton is fascinated, in the turmoil of the holiday Rimini, by three boats from which chanting voices come. Four directors for as many stories by Tonino Guerra. Some more elegant than incisive, others of greater consistency, but it is the project that does not work. Thanks also to a talented Maddalena Fellini, Federico's sister, the episode of Giordana is the most successful.</description>

To free her, the hero He Man and his faithful depart with the cosmic key invented by the dwarf Gwildor. But a mistake causes them to fall to Earth where they meet Julie and her boyfriend Kelvin who have come into possession of the cosmic key. After an epic duel between He Man and Skeletor, good triumphs. Here the heroes of cardboard are transformed into "living" characters; the papier-mâché background is identical. He Man is Dolf Lundgren, the Ivan "I split you in two" Dragon from "Rocky IV".</description>

Sent to assist children in an institution, she uses these skills to alleviate the suffering of her little friends, including, in particular, those of Dominique, a very sensitive child. Although reluctant, the nun makes a record with some of her songs destined for other religious institutes, but someone spreads it and Sister Anna achieves tremendous success.</description>
		<notes>Specialist in films dedicated to girls who are crazy for music, Koster uses here the smiling grace of Debbie Reynolds, barely touching on a serious topic such as vocation in crisis and resolving it on the level of lightness.</notes>

		<description>In a village in the Lower Po Valley, in the immediate post-war period, a Communist mayor was elected: Giuseppe Bottazzi known as Peppone. To counter him in every way is the parish priest, the combative Don Camillo. The "reds" proclaim an agricultural strike and Don Camillo does everything to make it fail, but then he does not refuse to bless the Casa del Popolo and gives the baptism to the last born of his rival. In their love-hate, in their battles and in their alliances, in their intrigues and in their peaceful coexistence, the two characters represent the Italian struggling with politics in the years of the Reconstruction. Indifferent, but we still laugh with gusto.</description>

		<description>We are in the years of protest and the youth rebellion does not spare even the village of Brescello. Peppone's son is an extra-parliamentarian and a young priest in the mood for post-conciliar innovations puts the traditionalist parish priest in crisis. More tares are brought by Caterina, a restless niece of Don Camillo.</description>
		<notes>Mario Camerini agreed to continue shooting the film, which had been interrupted due to Fernandel's death, replacing the French actor with Gastone Moschin. Despite the old master's signature, the operation is a bit silly.</notes>

		<description>Don Camillo and Peppone have left the village and live in Rome: one is a senator, the other a monsignor of the Curia. In the Bassa, however, the souls of the villagers have not changed and are always prone to political brawl. The reason for the dispute, this time, is the construction of new social housing in a land on which stands a small votive chapel much venerated. By their respective superiors, the two old lions are sent back to the country to attempt mediation which results in the most classic of "historical compromises".</description>

		<description>In a Sicilian village there is a strong rivalry between the two local parish priests. Don Franco, who has progressive sympathies, is accused of having given way to the Communists during a strike with a subsequent road block. His suspicion is that Don Ciccio, the conservative, reported him to the bishop. The final battle will take place on a football field and will end in tarallucci and wine.</description>

Faced with Ferguson, paralyzed with dizziness, the woman throws herself off a steeple, or so the poor agent believes. But one day a chance encounter puts everything back on the line.</description>
		<notes>One of the best films in the history of cinema. The direction functional to the story, to suspense, to the intertwining of bodies and ghosts, reaches the heights of the sublime. A great film of love and death, set against the backdrop of a dreamlike San Francisco. The whole first part is ambiguous and mysterious, then more and more morbid, and a chilling ending. The twists and turns of the script do not count, it counts hypnosis and atmosephra, the extraordinary double Kim Novak. Extraordinary photography by Robert Burks and music by Bernard Herrmann.</notes>

He admired a painting in a shop window depicting a beautiful woman and she - of whom he knows nothing - enters a dream of his, pleasant at first (their sentimental relationship), but which then turns into a real nightmare. Fritz Lang, the director, one of the famous refugees from Nazi Germany, made films of varying value in the United States. This is one of his most successful, for the complexity of the topics addressed, for the search for an adequate narrative style and for the considerable contribution of the performers, all actors of excellent profession very skilfully guided in demanding roles.</description>

A comedy set in a western setting, with some weaknesses in the script and without a particular "vis comica", almost entirely on the shoulders of the actors.</description>

Once landed in Sicily, the two continue the journey together, but it soon becomes clear that the mafia has nothing to do with it and that the boy is simply trying. Angela lets herself be conquered and shortly after Salvo is accidentally killed. The film contemplates an inexhaustible series of clichés and obviousness. The only thing to save is of course Greta Scacchi. But why does he get caught up in such weak films?</description>

Here his wife will join him again and agree to be close to him "submissive" to the memory of the deceased. A new crisis will finally lead the couple to clarification and a new happy life. Powerful and shot in evocative backgrounds, the film was left unfinished due to the war and came out in a patched version in '45.

When the latter dies suddenly, the girl is accused of murder, thus discovering the true intentions of her accomplice.</description>

		<description>Gary and Wyatt are two shy and inexperienced 15-year-olds. Watching "Frankenstein" on television they decide to make a "dream woman" using a computer. The result is beyond imagination and is something explosive. But Lisa - as the two friends call the creature - turns out to be more of a charming and protective fairy than her invoked lover.</description>
		<notes>That is, how to harness the wild reveries of two teenagers in a sweetened admonition to sentimental order. In this moralizing tale Kelly Le Brock (the "lady in red") is just a foreign "body".</notes>

		<description>Katharine Parkler (Sigourney Weaver) is an ambitious and brilliant executive of an established New York stock exchange firm. Apparently Katharine is very open to her young secretary Tess McGill (Melanie Griffith), a young man of modest background, but determined to improve her position and therefore always full of new projects and ideas. So it becomes almost natural that, when Katharine gets stuck in Europe due to an injury on the ski slopes, it is her enterprising secretary who replaces her at work. Of course without saying anything to anyone. Tess thus finds herself dealing with an important business in first person (the acquisition of a local radio station) and for this reason she asks for the help of the skilled and charming manager Jack Trainer (Harrison Ford), Katharine's lover and unaware of the true position of Tess. The deal proceeds and the two, working side by side, obviously end up falling in love too. But at the most beautiful Katharine returns home, discovers everything and tries to boycott Tess's work in every way.</description>
		<notes>Close and crackling comedy. The two antagonists, Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver, run at full speed and Harrison Ford supports them with intelligence. Of course, we sided with Tess, but the ferocious irony of the last shot puts everything back into proportion.</notes>

		<description>Moved by an irresistible desire for independence, Liana abandons her betrothed Fernando shortly before the wedding to escape with Gerardo, a musician. So she goes to live in Paris where she ends up marrying a rich man, but regrets it after just a year. Back home, she has a violent argument with Gerardo which ends tragically. The protagonist's irresolution and her unsettled restlessness translate awkwardly into a juxtaposition of contradictory choices and attitudes that are poorly illuminated by an elementary psychological excavation. And Françoise Cressoy does not contribute to making everything more credible.</description>

		<description>At the end of the last century a girl (Katharine Hepburn), following a bitter disappointment in love that makes it impossible for her to marry her daughter's father, tries a career as a writer, becoming very famous in a short time. After a few other intricate sentimental events, everything turns out for the best. Don't be fooled by the plot that seems to have been borrowed from one of the thousands of soap operas that crowd our television screens these days: the film, from 1936, actually anticipates a lot of classic themes of feminism. The careful and discreet direction is by Mark Sandrich, one of the most successful musical specialists.</description>

		<description>Having abandoned her husband, abusive and drunkard, Marie Ragghianti makes a career in the administration of justice. He realizes, however, that he is, in spite of himself, little more than a tool for the shady trafficking of the governor of the state. After the delay, he reports everything to the FBI. The war between her and the politician, at that point, goes on with no holds barred. Eventually Marie manages, despite the obstacles, to get to the trial. Roger Donaldson hasn't shown much of himself. The film is monotonous, supported only by its intent of civil denunciation and by the commitment of Sissy Spacek in the role of Marie. The title reminds us that the story told actually took place in Tennessee.</description>

		<description>We are in the environment of the American upper class. Mary, tired of being betrayed by her husband, goes to Reno where a quick divorce can be obtained. Here he meets other women who have had similar experiences to hers. Despite the situation, however, when she learns that her husband's new bond is failing because of the other, Mary unexpectedly chooses to reconcile.</description>
		<notes>While always talking about men, there are only women on stage. Cukor with films like this (based on a play by Claire Booth Luce) earned her reputation as a "women's director". This is one of his masterpieces, which surpasses the genre of sophisticated comedy with cruel feminism.</notes>

During one of these, the four get to know those who immediately become their girlfriends. But the military service arrives: after trying in every way to avoid it, the four find themselves in the same barracks. For an award license, they agree to play for the commander's party, but find themselves caught up in a rivalry between soldiers that ends in a general brawl.</description>

		<description>US Army engineers are mapping an important communication route through Texas. We are in 1840, at the time of the annexation of Texas to the States of the Union. The Mexicans, however, refuse to cooperate; a fake settler caravan is thus sent, actually made up of soldiers and ex-prisoners. Good example of a western in which the classic element of adventure is contaminated by the tone of comedy.</description>

When the French invade the kingdom of Naples, Michele is transformed into the impregnable Fra 'Diavolo, who will get his beauty after endless adventures.</description>

The situation precipitates but, thanks to the case, after chases and quiproquo, everything is fine.</description>

		<description>We are in England in 1920. Ursula (Linden), a shy elementary school teacher, falls in love with Rupert (Bates), a school inspector who has been married for some time to the rich Elmione, but in the middle of a marriage crisis. Sister Gudrun (Jackson), a nonconformist sculptress, engages in a troubled passionate relationship with Laura's brother Gerald. And also between the two men a feeling will be born that the society of the time will not take long to define ambiguous.</description>
		<notes>The film is based on the novel of the same name by D.H. Lawrence. Ken Russell, famous for some visionary excesses, keeps his figurative whims in check here by focusing on the quality of the extraordinary performers (including Glenda Jackson who won the Oscar).</notes>

		<description>In 1971, when a body was found in his hotel room in Paris, Jim Morrison was just twenty-seven years old but had already entered the legend of rock. The film traces the stages of his fulminating career, mixing life and art and describing the delusional inner world and the wild life of the rock star.</description>
		<notes>Perhaps only a grandiloquent director like Oliver Stone could grapple with the legendary myths of young America. In this film there is the best and the worst of his cinema: breadth of means often used for somewhat obvious speeches, mythologizing of an era and moralism. Val Kilmer's performance in the transgressive role of the young Jim is noteworthy.</notes>

		<description>After the defeat of Waterloo, some families of Napoleonic fighters take refuge in Alabama, devoting themselves to agriculture. Florette, daughter of the community leader, has been promised to the mighty Blake Randolph but loves John Breen (Wayne), an uninspiring western, despite the original inspiration. Curious is the presence of Oliver Hardy / Ollio in the part of Willie.</description>

		<description>Lottie (Russell) is a female police officer who works exclusively undercover. Her action zone is Hollywood where, dressed in a provocative way, she acts as a bait for sex maniacs and drug dealers. After a failed marriage, Lottie is alone and her professional life is hell. Stan (Fahey), deputy district attorney, assigns her to work on a large drug trade. The two fall in love immediately, but Lottie is full of doubts and fears. One evening he accepts an invitation from a stranger (who turns out to be a well-known gangster) and is so casually present when he is eliminated by a mala killer. Determined not to get involved in the case, she dismisses all evidence of his presence.</description>
		<notes>The second film directed by Sondra Locke (who had been Clint Eastwood's partner and favorite star) is an interesting and tense attempt at a female thriller. Theresa Russell's acting is remarkable.</notes>

		<description>Veronika is a 20-year-old from Krakow, with a wonderful voice. Singing is her main passion, so much so that she leaves the boy she loves to devote herself entirely to singing. And die on stage from a heart attack. Véronique is identical to the other, but she is French, and when she realizes that the malformation in her heart could be fatal, if she continues to sing, she gives up art and takes refuge in love. Two parallel lives, two different fates.</description>
		<notes>In an atmosphere between magic and psychological analysis, an exciting film, directed with hypnotic and enigmatic style by Kieslowski and excellently interpreted, in the double role, by Irène Jacob, awarded as best actress at Cannes. Superb soundtrack by Zbigniew Preisner.</notes>

		<description>Scott and Charlene operate with a very specific specialization: they target rich and sentimentally fragile women, induce them to commit actions they should be ashamed of and then blackmail them, stripping them of their possessions. When they are about to repeat the operation with Dawn, the wife of a businessman linked to the underworld, a third individual enters the scene and blackmails Scott and Charlene. Based on a short story by Bill Crenshow, the film is based on a sensing that goes a little too far in tangling the plot, but, on the other hand, uses a rather skilled storytelling technique in creating and maintaining tension and suspense.</description>

		<notes>From the greatest exponent of the "calligraphy artists", with the "fiancée of Italy" of the time. Mario Soldati's directorial debut was not loved by the public and critics. Instead, it is a refined and lively film, with excellent actors.</notes>

Between the guide Sol Rogers and Captain Harrod there is a rivalry for the love of a beautiful widow, but as the clash between the two approaches, friendship flourishes again. Sol will give his life to save Harrod. The expedition ends with a bloody battle that stops the revolt - an ordinary western with some good passages, notably the final battle. Laven is just a good craftsman, Sam Peckinpah writes a stereotypical script.</description>

		<description>Entering the hospital in 1973 for an ulcer, Miles Monroe wakes up two hundred years later. Meanwhile, nuclear war broke out and the world was divided into two blocs, one of which was commanded by the "Great Leader". Miles pretends to be a robot and manages to escape, then joins the rebels and enters a laboratory where they attempt to clone the leader with what's left of him after an attack.</description>
		<notes>From the narrative pretext of time travel, to the homage to Chaplin in "Modern Times" passing, of course, through the corrosiveness of Jewish humor, Allena uses the society of the future for a satirical look at America in the 70s.</notes>

		<description>Dr. Jekyll is not limited to his activity as an illustrious scientist, but is also interested in the studies on psychoanalysis inaugurated by Sigmund Freud. It is precisely in order to follow both lines of research that he experiments on himself a liquid of his own invention. The situation gets out of hand and every night he transforms into Mr. Hyde, a sinister killer of prostitutes. More sweetened and traditional than Mamoulian's version of '32, it remains one of the most famous versions of Stevenson's novel, imbued with sexual implications and psychoanalytic elaborations (including two sequences illustrating the dreams of the mad doctor) and a cast that includes the best actors under contract with Metro.</description>

		<description>Discovered by the police, Dr. Mabuse (Klein-Rogge), a thug, cheater and who uses his hypnotist skills to make others succubus, takes refuge in a secret hiding place. Detained by the prosecutor Wenck (Goetzke) will end up in an asylum anyway. The film has become a classic of German cinema, based on the novel by Norbert Jacques and written by the director himself with his faithful companion Thea Von Harbou. Fritz Lang, who directs with great skill, reprized the character twice more, once in 1933 with "Doctor Mabuse's Testament" and, for the last time in 1960 with "The diabolical Doctor Mabuse".</description>

		<description>To cover up his not-too-honest brother, Jack is forced to become a bandit, but one of those nice, imaginative and brilliant ones. His specialty is mockery of the powerful and escapes from British prisons. But his main challenge is against the hateful police chief, at the same time lord of the underworld. Singer Tommy Steele (here only actor) is this character who really existed in eighteenth-century London, adored by the populace who hated his rival. The facts are not particularly detailed, but the adventures are pleasantly narrated, and vividly described in good ambient scenes.</description>

		<description>Little Ahmad realizes that he has mistakenly taken the notebook of the homework of Mohammed, his classmate; He thus escapes the surveillance of his mother to reach his friend's village, return the notebook to him and avoid punishment. The little protagonist knows that he must make the journey driven by the strength of friendship in opposition to the authoritarianism that characterizes relationships with adults. The film is a miraculous balance of poetry and realism. The Iranian Abbas Kiarostami, who revealed himself with this film, knows how to tell very characterized stories in the setting with a universal language.</description>

		<description>Irving returns to his hometown to donate the house, which his father left him as an inheritance, to the family of a girl who committed suicide there following an affair with Irving's parent. But something is wrong: several people are ready to swear that the girl is not dead. Trained at Ermanno Olmi's "school" in Bassano, Zaccaro discreetly made his debut in a commercial feature film with a detective story shot in America, supported by a screenplay by Pupi Avati.</description>

		<description>Link Jones was a robber in his youth, then paid his debt to justice and got his head right. While he is bringing his fellow citizens' money for school, he is attacked by a group of bandits, one of whom recognizes and blackmails him. Link pretends to yield and participates in a robbery to protect the other hostages in the hands of criminals: then he kills the robbers, rescues the hostages and delivers the money entrusted to him.</description>
		<notes>The western seen by Anthony Mann is closely related to the Greek tragedy; plus there is also an aged Gary Cooper here, with an unforgettable look and step. This is the last of his great westerns. Adult, of few words and of great sensitivity.</notes>

		<notes>The screenwriter Alistair McLean re-cooks many ingredients of his other script (that of _I cannoni di Navarone_): the result is an unlikely film, but enjoyable on a spectacular level. Clint Eastwood was on his first film that wasn't a spaghetti western.</notes>

The journey is far from smooth and becomes even more complicated when the provisions (already paid for) for the winter are slow to arrive from Portland. Furthermore, Cole decides to betray Glynn and to put himself at the service of the gold miners, to the detriment of the pioneers. But Glyn's revenge is relentless.</description>

		<description>Film in three episodes. Carlo would like to take advantage of the summer to restore his relationship with his wife from whom he has recently separated for adultery. The woman first niches, then accepts a meeting. Arturo is involved in a crime by a beautiful Italian he met during a stay in Africa. In the third and longer episode, Remo is forced by his children to spend a "smart vacation" with his wife.</description>
		<notes>Of all the authors and actors of the film the only one who still manages to make people laugh, albeit with a visible effort, is Sordi who, however, begins to repeat himself and, what is worse, to become a moralist. His character of the average Italian is less and less convincing.</notes>

		<description>Paul is a young genius of electronics applied to brain research. Bee Bee is a very sophisticated robot built by Paul for self-defense and other services, which is destroyed by a neighbor. Samantha, whom Paul falls in love with, who is accidentally killed by her drunk father. The boy does not resign himself to his death, he kidnaps the body kept in the morgue; in the brain it then inserts the microcircuits of the destroyed Bee Bee. Samantha actually comes back to life, but as a vengeful robot that sows death.</description>
		<notes>Craven's horror may appear grungy at times, but it must be acknowledged that he often manages to achieve a revealing unsustainability. The director of "Nightmare" is also capable of juggling with special effects and cinematic winks. Even when, as in this case, not everything is convincing, it leaves its mark while using materials that are at first sight worn.</notes>

		<description>An alien race, with species perpetuation problems, sends an emissary to earth to study the sexual mores of humans. The alien incarnates in the body of a college science teacher who, as an experiment, makes one of her students grow a tentacle on her forehead. The boy gets into trouble with his girlfriend, but becomes the idol of all the peers. A single idea (not too subtle), a bunch of girls in the shower and a bunch of mediocre rock music are the ingredients of this film. If you really can't help but see it, at least look in the group Ginger Lynn, she is a famous pornstar. Troy Donahue, on the other hand, was the big baby protagonist of "Scandal in the sun", an idol of teenagers in the early 60s.</description>

The film, one of the first horror films produced in Technicolor, was nominated for an Oscar for successful, and still enjoyable, special effects. Flamboyant photography, effective interpretation of Albert Dekker, archetypal Hollywood villain, in the part of the mad scientist.</description>

		<description>In nineteenth-century Victorian London, Dr. Jekyll is an esteemed scientist. One day he isolates a liquid that separates the positive and negative parts of people and experiences it on himself. The situation gets out of hand: he periodically transforms himself into the cruel Mr. Hyde, who roams the city every night committing terrible crimes. The police set out on his trail but would not be able to discover the truth if the scientist, realizing the situation, did not favor the killing of his terrible alter ego.</description>

Christopher Lee remains the sexiest Dracula on the screen. In a memorable scene, he cuts his chest with a fingernail and makes a girl drink the blood. Erotic.</notes>

		<notes>The film is an apocryphal episode of the "poor but beautiful" series, basically a promotional spot of marriage and regular life. Despite the paucity of the plot and the poorly inspired direction, it was a great success at the box office, definitively launching Corrado Pani and Valeria Moriconi.</notes>

The second has a love gone bad, a girl he has been with only once, but who has marked his life. If it weren't for the flashbacks related to the love story it would be a film all shot in the car and all talked about. Newcomer Jefery Levy, former screenwriter and former musician, still has to thank David Warner, formerly Morgan, crazy as hell, as well as Gielgud's bastard in Resnais' Providence.

Maxwell's daughter tries to seduce the two slaves but, rejected, takes revenge by accusing Blaise of obscene acts who, chained, is freed by Drum. A bloody revolt breaks out in which Blaise is killed: Drum manages to escape. Rather useless sequel to the more famous "Mandingo", of which it keeps only the name. The popularity of the former has been replaced by a seesaw of brutality and brutality, in which it is sad to see a great actor like Warren Oates ("The Wild Bunch") involved.</description>

		<description>Franco and Ciccio are brothers-in-law, but, although they are relatives, they are continually at loggerheads, also complicit in the wives who hate each other. They both work in the same public office so they often come to quarrels. In view of the political elections, the electoral committee of the Christian Democrats decides to nominate Ciccio, to which the PCI is a surprising candidate for Franco. All the more reason to fight especially when Franco is elected and Ciccio is not. The death of a deputy also allows Ciccio to enter parliament at which the quarrels continue.</description>

		<description>Taylor is a charming young television meteorologist who goes from one adventure to another. His friends decide to find the right woman for him. The trouble is that thanks to them there are even three right women, two too many. But Taylor is in love with only one, this time seriously. The comedy is more brilliant in the first part than in the second. Taylor's agitation between the three candidates ends up being a bit too mechanical and obvious. The fun suffers. Mark Harmon is Sean Connery's antagonist in The Garrison, Lesley Ann Warren is Victor Victoria's goofy blonde.</description>

Calamity Jane, who is Franco and Ciccio's aunt, entrusts them with the map of a treasure to be found, but the cheat "Quattro Assi" precedes them (for the moment). Cium Cim Ciampa's gang is vanquished with the help of a group of friars. Osvaldo Civirani (who would later be director Richard Kean) wasted, with a botched screenplay, his own good starting idea: parodying many stories of the West together.

During the escape, the friendship between the fugitives and the dumb daughter that François wanted to heal with the money of the coup is cemented.</description>

		<description>Antonio Capurro performs his "blows" in cassock. Discovered by Marshal Cottone, he also manages to steal his uniform. But in Italy on September 8 it is not a brilliant idea. Capurro will end up deported to Germany but Marshal Cottone will be able to realize that the thief has been saved. And that has not lost neither the hair nor the vice.</description>
		<notes>There were all the elements to make a serious film or, perhaps, a grotesque comedy. Instead, the path of farce was preferred. Of course the interpreters go wild: Totò and De Sica obviously; but the revelation is Gianni Agus "comrade".</notes>

		<description>Clarence and Jo are two offshore sailors around Los Angeles. It is by chance that they meet Susan, a young singer obsessed with the idea of ??getting an audition from the famous maestro Iturbi. Jo (the smarter of the two) immediately explains to her - pretending - that Clarence is an old friend of Iturbi. Fortunately, the problem of actually contacting the teacher resolves itself.</description>

		<description>Two US marines of Sicilian origin are prisoners of the Germans in Africa. The German general who has them in custody in the prison camp lets them escape after having equipped them with false war plans that must be used to deceive the enemy. Instead, the plans are authentic, so the trap turns against the one who had designed it.</description>
		<notes>Buster Keaton in his sad sunset plays the role of the German general. The comparison of his comedy with that, much more coarse, of the two Sicilian actors, could be a good opportunity. But the film is very patchy and you only laugh at times.</notes>

		<description>The long Dexter is an American who lives in London and acts as "shoulder" to Ron, the famous comedian. He goes to the doctor because of an allergy and meets Kate, a nurse he falls in love with. Everything is fine, but here comes Cheryl, a pretty good redhead, and then Dexter argues with Ron, who fires him. Ours, however, does not lose heart: he finds a job as an elephant man in a show and even hires a friend. There is only one problem: Kate, jealous, left him because of the redhead. But Dexter cares about his nurse and makes a decision ... Goldblum and Thompson save the salvage of this English comedy that is supposed to be bizarre. In a secondary part also the future Mr. Bean.</description>

		<description>In the first episode (by Romero) Jessica and Robert want to collect the inheritance of Valdemar, husband of Jessica. They mesmerize him to change the will but he turns into a zombie and pursues the two lovers. In the second part (by Argento), the alcoholic photographer Rod makes his fortune by photographing a cat quartered by him. The girlfriend notices it and the man walls her alive with another cat.</description>
		<notes>The episode of Argento is ugly and negligible. More music for Romero, who builds a small suspense masterpiece. Once again the real monsters are not zombies but men, motivated only by greed. Special Effects by Tom Savini.</notes>

In trying to assert his rights he also risks his skin. In the end, however, it all turns out to be a bad dream.</description>

Their union still seems perfect, in reality a certain restlessness winds between them. The disagreements eventually lead to extramarital escapades, but a serious rethinking of the past leads the couple to realize how solid their bond is.</description>
		<notes>Director Stanley Donen made the story of a wedding with a rather original method: by grafting the episodes of the present and the past into each other. Interesting path, also thanks to the two talented protagonists. Beautiful music by Henry Mancini.</notes>

		<description>Will Cross and Frank Boone have never managed to emerge in the Wild West, where other gunslingers have always been faster and more skilled. Indeed, one day they are robbed of gold that they found after a long time spent in the mountains. They hunt down criminals but first run into a group of rebel Apaches and then a gang of Mexican desperados. One way or another they will manage to get away with it. Parody directed by Burt Kennedy, who in the 1950s had written some masterpieces such as The Seven Murderers. Among the performers there is also Jack Elam, the cross-eyed with the gibberish face of many westerns.</description>

He gets the chance to visit the family one last time and the other offers himself as a hostage. Paolo Lorenzini (grandson of Collodi from "Pinocchio") wrote the novel: a classic of popular literature.

Here he ends up taking the place of the director, who is ill, but this does not translate for him into a new security of his means, quite the contrary. Jack's wife also arrives in Rome, looking for a reconciliation.</description>
		<notes>It is a bit of a sequel to Minnelli's "Bruto e la bella", with Cinecittà instead of Hollywood. The version planned by Minnelli was extensively reworked from the production, but nevertheless retains a nice bite and has a sincere decadent atmosphere. Based on a good novel by Irwin Shaw.</notes>

		<description>Franco and Ciccio, zealous motorcycle policemen, become the involuntary accomplices of a robbery. Thinking they are escorting a minister's car to the airport, they end up facilitating a robber's escape. Intended for the humblest of services, they combine one mess after another. One day, they think they see in the garden of a villa the car that the robber had used for his escape.</description>
		<notes>Just enough comedy of the most famous comedy couple of the 70s. Some scenes still arouse fun and there is also a moment with Franco Franchi in a dramatic version.</notes>

		<description>Former football player, Terry Brogan is sent by his friend Jake Wise to the Yucatan in search of Jesse, daughter of wealthy Mrs. Wyler. Terry finds her and falls in love with her. He discovers that the girl has been Jake's lover and that his mother is involved in shady dealings. The couple returns to Los Angeles, where however they are divided by a climate of heavy blackmail.</description>
		<notes>The film is the remake of Jacques Tourneur's clearly inferior "Chains of Guilt". However, the noir story works and the two protagonists are good. Phil Collins's song "Against All Odds" became an international hit.</notes>

		<description>Harry Mackenzie, a metal worker from Seattle, leads a quiet life divided between work, bar and family. On her fiftieth birthday, celebrating with friends at the usual bar, she falls in love with the new waitress: she is love at first sight. The result is a love story that soon leads the two to coexistence. At home it is the eldest daughter who takes the worst of all. Shot by Bud Yorkin after a twelve-year absence from a studio, the film is a painful account of a family's behavior towards their father's adultery, but shot with the light tones of comedy using good dialogue and good actors.</description>

		<description>Rep David Mann is driving to a customer. The driver of a tanker in front of him invites David to overtake; in turn then overtakes it at high speed. Little by little the "game" turns into a manhunt with clearly murderous intentions.</description>
		<notes>Mann ("man") David (against Goliath): ordinary individual in an extraordinary context. From the very first film, Spielberg knows exactly which button to press to make it easier for the viewer to identify. A film originally shot for TV, which throws itself into America's heart of darkness (the increasingly wild and "western" landscape) telling an exemplary story. Exceptional pace.</notes>

		<description>Traveling to Fort Creel, Jess Remsberg frees a white woman who lived as a slave to an Indian tribe, and brings her back to her husband. The pair, along with Jess and a cavalry squadron make their way to another fort, but are attacked by the Indians. Jess runs in search of help but, when he returns, he finds the small caravan massacred: only the woman and her son (had by the Indian chief) were saved. Violent, lively, an "adult" and multiracial western from the director who five years later will sign "Blue Soldier".</description>

As soon as he is released from prison, Felix rushes to get the money. Not content with trying to seduce Hardy's wife and engaging in a series of crimes. In the end it will be Don, freed, to stop the sequence of misdeeds.</description>

		<description>Pearl is a passionate girl, the daughter of a dancer who was killed by her husband out of jealousy. Raised in a God-fearing family, she meets the violent and possessive Lew; she feels attracted to it in spite of herself and becomes its lover. He dominates her and ends up killing his own brother Jack, who tried to make her repent. Between Pearl and Lew it all ends in a tragic final confrontation. King Vidor (who signs the film, although Sternberg, Willem Dieterle and Otto Brewer took turns directing him) masterfully intertwines western and melodrama in this torrid and baroque film, marked by the intervention of David O'Selznick, screenwriter and producer . Excellent cast and great work on color, to underline the ferocity of passions. The final duel / embrace is famous. It was a scandal: the sexy Jones had just been Bernadette in a very pious film.</description>

		<description>Having become co-owner of the Dodge City saloon, Barth Masterson finds himself having to face the men of Regan, a local boss who, in order to dominate better, wants to be nominated sheriff at all costs. Barth manages to prevent this by becoming a sheriff himself and thus putting a spoke in the wheel of Regan's men. The attempt to restore legality, however, ends up costing him very dearly, in emotional terms, but the showdown with Regan is only a matter of time.</description>

The American manages to find out who the traitor is, while Sally falls in love with him; for his part, the English officer accepts the shooting without batting an eye.</description>

Arrested and subjected to harsh interrogation, he is only offered freedom if he is ready to declare that he has received orders from his government to kill Hitler.</description>

		<description>During the Second World War, a missing American pilot and a Japanese officer find themselves living together on a desert island. They start a personal war, but then work together to organize the escape. Almost friends now, they come to another island; in an abandoned warehouse they find Japanese and US material. Regaining consciousness of their respective nationality, they abruptly separate.</description>
		<notes>Boorman throws himself into the enterprise of this curious anti-war apologue, relying on the extraordinary faces of Toshiro Mifune and Lee Marvin. Inspired by the direction of the visionary English director, even if the project (only two characters on a desert island, almost total lack of dialogue) may appear artificial. The director makes a reflection not only on man, but also on the nature of vision (the final close-up of the eye that preludes the explosion) and maintains a certain hidden sense of humor.</notes>

		<description>Dumbo, son of the elephant Jumbo, has two huge protruding ears and for this he is teased by the other elephants of the circus. The poor guy is lonely and dejected, but he meets a true friend in a mouse with an unbridled fantasy. It will be he who will discover that, thanks to his huge ears, the little pachyderm will be able to fly. Dumbo thus becomes the real star of the circus.</description>
		<notes>Very famous, a classic in children's cinematic imagery for several generations. Amazing design, engaging, supported by perfectly timed music (one for all: the blues in the choir of the crows watching the first flight of the elephant) that won the Oscar. The dream scene of the pink elephants is visionary.</notes>

		<notes>From the famous saga signed by Frank Herbert, here is a real cult destined for all fans of director David Lynch, who moves with ease between science fiction and mystical instances. Widely manipulated by the producer De Laurentiis, and therefore full of discontinuities (after all the events of the Herbert saga were exterminated), it nevertheless maintains happy moments.</notes>

The politician then sends a gang of brutal killers to Mason's house to attack her. Mason, seriously injured, remains in a coma for seven years, assisted only by a splendid nurse (Le Brock) who, in love with him, does not stop hoping for his recovery. He regains consciousness, but when Trent finds out, he sends his henchmen again to kill him. The nurse rescues him again and in a safe place helps him in rehabilitation therapy. Mason is soon able to take on the gang. The film is eventful but crude.</description>

		<notes>It seems that the story and the protagonist are real, at least in substance. However, the film is told according to the most well-known stereotypes of a thousand similar stories, born from fantasy. Thus the picture of a society lying in illegality until the rescue of the spotless and fearless hero ends up appearing totally conventional.</notes>

		<description>Art Long (Quaid) lives as best he can by singing country music, which he himself composes, in small provincial clubs. However, what he earns is not enough to support his wife Caroline and son, so much so that he is forced to change jobs. Embraced his career as a boxer he became famous under the name of Country Western Warrior. The film is not bad: Dennis Quaid was a rising star and the presence of Warren Oates, albeit in a minor role, is always good news. But the idea that an ephebic singer of ballads and lullabies can suddenly become a boxing champion is hard to swallow.</description>
